        "title": "Analysis of GFAP variants in UK Biobank suggests underdiagnosis or incomplete penetrance of adult-onset Alexander disease.",
        "abstract": "Alexander disease is an autosomal dominant leukodystrophy caused by heterozygous pathogenic variants in the glial fibrillar acidic protein (GFAP) gene. Although increasingly recognised, there is evidence that Alexander disease, particularly later-onset disease, is significantly underdiagnosed and its true prevalence is unknown (the only population-based prevalence was estimated at one in 2.7\u2009million). Using the extensive UK Biobank dataset, we analysed the frequency of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants, <i>GFAP</i> variants, within the UK population and identified clinical and radiological phenotypes linked to these variants. Pathogenic, likely pathogenic and <i>GFAP</i> variants of uncertain significance were identified in the UK Biobank whole-exome sequencing data (n=4\u200970\u2009000). Demographic information, previous medical history-including symptoms associated with Alexander disease-collected from self-reported data and hospital records, family history and various MRI metrics were compared between variant carriers and controls. We identified 36 unique pathogenic and likely pathogenic <i>GFAP</i> variants in 106 carriers, yielding a carrier frequency of approximately 1 in 4435. Modelling based on the UK population estimated a prevalence of 6.8 per 100\u2009000. Carriers of pathogenic and likely pathogenic <i>GFAP</i> variants had higher odds of bladder dysfunction (OR 3.17, p<0.0001), upper airway dysfunction (OR 7.82, p=0.004) and psychiatric conditions (OR 1.51, p=0.04). Additionally, carriers were more likely to report a paternal history of dementia (OR 2.79, p<0.0001). MRI data revealed significant atrophy in brainstem regions among variant carriers. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic <i>GFAP</i> variants are more prevalent in the general population than previously expected and are associated with clinical and radiological characteristics of Alexander disease. This study indicates that Alexander disease may be under-reported, misdiagnosed, or exhibit reduced penetrance.",

        "title": "Establishment and Use of Primary Cultured Astrocytes from Alexander Disease Model Mice.",
        "abstract": "Alexander disease (AxD) is an intractable neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in <i>glial fibrillary acidic protein</i> (<i>GFAP</i>), which is predominantly expressed in astrocytes. Thus, AxD is a primary astrocyte disease. However, it remains unclear how <i>GFAP</i> mutations affect astrocytes and cause AxD pathology. Three features are characteristic of AxD astrocytes <i>in vivo</i>: (1) Rosenthal fibers (RFs), the hallmark of AxD; (2) aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (AxCa); and (3) upregulation of disease-associated genes (AxGen). We established a primary culture system for astrocytes from an AxD transgenic mouse model, and used it to analyze the above features of AxD pathogenesis in astrocytes <i>in vitro</i>. We observed the formation of RFs in AxD primary cultures. The abundance of RFs was greater in AxD-transgene-homozygous compared with -hemizygous astrocytes, indicating a gene dosage effect, and this abundance increased with time in culture, indicating a developmental process effect. However, cultured AxD astrocytes did not exhibit changes in either AxCa or AxGen. We therefore conclude that RFs in astrocytes form via a cell-autonomous mechanism, whereas AxCa and AxGen are likely to occur via a non-cell-autonomous mechanism through interactions with other cells, such as neurons, microglia, and vascular cells. Although primary cultured AxD astrocytes are suitable for elucidating the mechanisms of RFs formation and for intervention studies, it should be noted that they cannot reflect the pathophysiology of non-cell-autonomous events in astrocytes.",

        "title": "Response to amoxicillin and perampanel in infantile Alexander disease.",
        "abstract": "Type I Alexander disease (AxD) presents with paroxysmal neurodegeneration, refractory epilepsy, and encephalopathy in the first years of life and is associated with a poor prognosis. Although there is no treatment, mild symptomatic improvement has been reported in one case of adult Alexander treated with ceftriaxone, given its interaction with the mutant glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) responsible for the disease's pathogenesis. We describe a patient presenting with irritability starting at 2\u2009months of age, initially attributed to gastroesophageal reflux. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed at 3\u2009months of age due to hydrocephalus secondary to aqueduct stenosis detected through an MRI scan, but the irritability persisted. At 5\u2009months, a new brain MRI was performed due to irritability worsening, onset of abnormal ocular movements and seizures. In addition genetic testing was performed. AxD was diagnosed due to the mutation c.716G>A (p.Arg239His) in GFAP. Since irritability had worsened and had not responded to levomepromazine, treatment with amoxicillin (80\u2009mg/kg/day) was attempted to modulate glutamate levels. The patient showed a striking improvement of irritability in 48\u2009h that persisted over the next months. The patient had frequent daily seizures which did not respond to valproate, clonazepam, or phenobarbital. Perampanel, a postsynaptic AMPA receptor antagonist, was added to phenobarbital and he was seizure free for more than 3\u2009months. Drugs modulating glutamate levels in the central nervous system, including \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and perampanel, may have an important role in the symptomatic treatment of AxD and other neurodegenerative diseases where glutamatergic excitotoxicity is a pathogenic determinant. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Alexander disease is a rare and serious condition that affects the brain, often leading to neurodegeneration (brain damage), seizures, and other problems in early childhood. The disease is caused by a mutation in a gene called GFAP. There is no cure, and current treatments mainly focus on relieving symptoms. This article discusses the case of a baby who showed signs of irritability and seizures from a young age. The baby was diagnosed with Alexander disease after brain scans and genetic testing. Despite treatment with various drugs, the baby continued to experience seizures and irritability. The doctors decided to try amoxicillin, a common antibiotic, because of its potential to help control the disease by affecting a brain chemical called glutamate. Surprisingly, the baby's irritability improved within 2\u2009days of starting amoxicillin, and the improvement lasted for several months. However, the seizures persisted until another medication, perampanel, was added. This combination controlled the baby's seizures for over 3\u2009months. Unfortunately, the baby passed away at 13\u2009months due to complications from the disease. However, doctors believe that drugs like amoxicillin and perampanel could be promising treatments for managing symptoms of Alexander disease and other similar brain conditions in the future, especially where excess glutamate plays a role in the damage. This case suggests that these treatments may help control irritability and seizures, offering hope for better management of this challenging disease.",

        "abstract": "Gain-of-function variants in GFAP leads to protein aggregation and is the cause of the severe neurodegenerative disorder Alexander Disease (AxD), while loss of GFAP function has been considered benign. Here, we investigated a six-generation family, where multiple individuals presented with gliosis of the optic nerve head and visual impairment. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) revealed a frameshift variant in GFAP (c.928dup, p.(Met310Asnfs*113)) segregating with disease. Analysis of human embryonic tissues revealed strong expression of GFAP in retinal neural progenitors. A zebrafish model verified that c.928dup does not result in extensive GFAP protein aggregation and zebrafish gfap loss-of-function mutants showed vision impairment and retinal dysplasia, characterized by a significant loss of M\u00fcller glia cells and photoreceptor cells. Our findings show how different mutational mechanisms can cause diverging phenotypes and reveal a novel function of GFAP in vertebrate eye development.",

        "abstract": "Alexander disease (ALXDRD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder of astrocytes resulting from pathogenic variants in the GFAP gene. The genotype-phenotype correlation remains elusive due to the variable expressivity of clinical manifestations. In an attempt to clarify the effects of GFAP variants in ALXDRD, numerous studies were collected and analyzed. In particular, we systematically searched for GFAP variants associated with ALXDRD and collected information on the location within the gene and protein, prediction of deleteriousness/pathogenicity, occurrence, sex and country of origin of patients, DNA source, genetic testing, and clinical signs. To identify possible associations, statistical analyses and meta-analyses were applied, thus revealing a higher than expected percentage of adult patients with ALXDRD. Furthermore, substitution of Arginine, the most frequently altered residue among the 550 predominantly missense causative GFAP variants collected, were mostly de novo and more prevalent in early-onset forms of ALXDRD. The effect of defective splicing in modifying the impact of GFAP variants on the age of onset of ALXDRD was also postulated after evaluating the distribution of the corresponding deleterious predictive values. In conclusion, not only previously unrecognized genotype-phenotype correlations were revealed in ALXDRD, but also subtle mechanisms could explain the variable manifestations of the ALXDRD clinical phenotype.",

        "abstract": "Intracranial calcification (ICC) occurs in many neurologic disorders both acquired and genetic. In some inherited white matter disorders, it is a common or even invariable feature where the presence and pattern of calcification provides an important pointer to the specific diagnosis. This is particularly the case for the Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome (AGS) and for Coats plus (CP) and leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts (LCC), which are discussed in detail in this chapter. AGS is a genetic disorder of type 1 interferon regulation, caused by mutations in any of the nine genes identified to date. In its classic form, AGS has very characteristic clinical and neuroimaging features which will be discussed here. LCC is a purely neurologic disorder caused by mutations in the SNORD118 gene, whereas CP is a multisystem disorder of telomere function that may result from mutations in the CTC1, POT1, or STN genes. In spite of the different pathogenetic basis for LCC and CP, they share remarkably similar neuroimaging and neuropathologic features. Cockayne syndrome, in which ICC is usually present, is discussed elsewhere in this volume. ICC may occur as an occasional feature of many other white matter diseases, including Alexander disease, Krabbe disease, X-ALD, and occulodentodigital dysplasia.",

Recent advances in genetic testing allow assessing gene panels that include several hundred genes; however, an MRI-based diagnostic approach is important to narrow the choice of candidate genes, particularly in countries where these techniques are not available. Indeed, white matter disorders with prominent posterior fossa involvement present specific MRI (and clinical) phenotypes that can directly orient the diagnosis.

        "abstract": "Alexander disease (AxD) is a rare and severe neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). While the exact disease mechanism remains unknown, previous studies suggest that mutant GFAP influences many cellular processes, including cytoskeleton stability, mechanosensing, metabolism, and proteasome function. While most studies have primarily focused on GFAP-expressing astrocytes, GFAP is also expressed by radial glia and neural progenitor cells, prompting questions about the impact of GFAP mutations on central nervous system (CNS) development. In this study, we observed impaired differentiation of astrocytes and neurons in co-cultures of astrocytes and neurons, as well as in neural organoids, both generated from AxD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells with a GFAP<sup>R239C</sup> mutation. Leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identified distinct cell populations and transcriptomic differences between the mutant GFAP cultures and a corrected isogenic control. These findings were supported by results obtained with immunocytochemistry and proteomics. In co-cultures, the GFAP<sup>R239C</sup> mutation resulted in an increased abundance of immature cells, while in unguided neural organoids and cortical organoids, we observed altered lineage commitment and reduced abundance of astrocytes. Gene expression analysis revealed increased stress susceptibility, cytoskeletal abnormalities, and altered extracellular matrix and cell-cell communication patterns in the AxD cultures, which also exhibited higher cell death after stress. Overall, our results point to altered cell differentiation in AxD patient-derived iPS-cell models, opening new avenues for AxD research.",

Of the approximately 50 leukodystrophies described to date, only eight have existing gene therapy clinical trials: metachromatic leukodystrophy, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, globoid cell leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, giant axonal neuropathy, GM2 gangliosidoses, Alexander disease and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. What led to the emergence of gene therapy trials for these specific disorders? What preclinical data or disease context was enabling? For each of these eight disorders, we first describe its pathophysiology and clinical presentation. We discuss the impact of gene therapy delivery route, targeted cell type, delivery modality, dosage, and timing on therapeutic efficacy. We note that use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in some leukodystrophies allowed for an accelerated path to clinic even in the absence of available animal models. In other leukodystrophies, small and large animal model studies enabled clinical translation of experimental gene therapies. Human clinical trials for the leukodystrophies include ex vivo lentiviral gene delivery, in vivo AAV-mediated gene delivery, and intrathecal antisense oligonucleotide approaches. We outline adverse events associated with each modality focusing specifically on genotoxicity and immunotoxicity. We review monitoring and management of events related to insertional mutagenesis and immune responses. The data presented in this review show that gene therapy, while promising, requires systematic monitoring to account for the precarious disease biology and the adverse events associated with new technology.",

External laryngeal tremor has not been reported in adult-onset Alexander disease (AOAxD). The aims of this work were to report one such case and to review the literature on palatopharyngeal tremor and AOAxD. A 43-year-old man experienced involuntary movements at the front of his neck. Continuous, rhythmic vertical movements of the laryngeal skeleton, soft palate and tongue, and lower limb dysmetria were observed. The pathogenic <i>GFAP</i> variant c.994G>A; p.(Glu332Lys) was found. MRI demonstrated spinal cord and medulla oblongata atrophy and hyperintensities at the cerebellum and cerebral white matter. External laryngeal, palatopharyngeal tremor and cerebellar ataxia constituted a mild phenotype, as expected from this variant, herein reported in isolation for the third time. Imaging was consistent with AOAxD, including the so-called tadpole sign. Additional studies are necessary to define this infrequent disease.",

        "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are a diverse group of diseases characterized by a progressive loss of neurological function due to damage to nerve cells in the central nervous system. In recent years, there has been a worldwide increase in the expanding associated with increasing human life expectancy. Molecular mechanisms control many of the essential life processes of cells, such as replication, transcription, translation, protein synthesis and gene regulation. These are complex interactions that form the basis for understanding numerous processes in the organism and developing new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, molecular basis refers to changes at the molecular level that cause damage to or degeneration of nerve cells. These may include protein aggregates leading to pathological structures in brain cells, impaired protein transport in nerve cells, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammatory processes or genetic mutations that impair nerve cell function. New medical therapies are based on these mechanisms and include gene therapies, reduction in inflammation and oxidative stress, and the use of miRNAs and regenerative medicine. The aim of this study was to bring together the current state of knowledge regarding selected neurodegenerative diseases, presenting the underlying molecular mechanisms involved, which could be potential targets for new forms of treatment.",

        "abstract": "Alexander disease is a rare, progressive leukodystrophy, which predisposes patients to complications under general anesthesia due to clinical manifestations including developmental delay, seizures, dysphagia, vomiting, and sleep apnea. However, study of anesthetic outcomes is limited. Our aim was to describe patient characteristics, anesthetic techniques, and anesthesia-related complications for Alexander disease patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging and/or lumbar puncture at a quaternary-care children's hospital. We performed a retrospective review of anesthetic outcomes in patients with Alexander disease enrolled in a prospective observational study. Included patients had diagnosed Alexander disease and underwent magnetic resonance imaging and/or lumbar puncture at our institution. We excluded anesthetics for other procedures or at outside institutions. Collected data included patient characteristics, anesthetic techniques, medications, and complications under anesthesia and in the subsequent 24\u2009h. We performed descriptive statistics as appropriate. Forty patients undergoing 64 procedures met inclusion criteria. Fifty-six procedures (87.5%) required general anesthesia or monitored anesthesia care (MAC) and eight (12.5%) did not. The general anesthesia/MAC group tended to be younger than nonanesthetized patients (median age 6\u2009years [IQR 3.8; 9] vs. 14.5\u2009years [IQR 12.8; 17.5]). In both groups, dysphagia (78.6% vs. 87.5%, respectively), seizures (62.5% vs. 25%), and recurrent vomiting (17.9% vs. 25%) were frequently reported preprocedure symptoms. Inhalational induction was common (N\u2009=\u200948; 85.7%), and two (3.6%) underwent rapid sequence induction. Serious complications were rare, with no aspiration or seizures. Hypotension resolving with ephedrine occurred in eight cases (14.3%). One patient each (1.8%) experienced postprocedure emergence agitation or vomiting. Fifty-three (94.6%) were ambulatory procedures. No inpatients required escalation in acuity of care. In this single-center study, patients with Alexander disease did not experience frequent or irreversible complications while undergoing general anesthesia/MAC. Co-morbid symptoms were not increased postanesthesia. Some patients may not require anesthesia to complete short procedures.",

        "abstract": "Here, we describe pathological events potentially involved in the disease pathogenesis of Alexander disease (AxD). This is a primary genetic disorder of astrocyte caused by dominant gain-of-function mutations in the gene coding for an intermediate filament protein glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Pathologically, this disease is characterized by the upregulation of GFAP and its accumulation as Rosenthal fibers. Although the genetic basis linking GFAP mutations with Alexander disease has been firmly established, the initiating events that promote GFAP accumulation and the role of Rosenthal fibers (RFs) in the disease process remain unknown. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that disease-associated mutations promote GFAP aggregation through aberrant posttranslational modifications. We found high molecular weight GFAP species in the RFs of AxD brains, indicating abnormal GFAP crosslinking as a prominent pathological feature of this disease. In\u00a0vitro and cell-based studies demonstrate that cystine-generating mutations promote GFAP crosslinking by cysteine-dependent oxidation, resulting in defective GFAP assembly and decreased filament solubility. Moreover, we found GFAP was ubiquitinated in RFs of AxD patients and rodent models, supporting this modification as a critical factor linked to GFAP aggregation. Finally, we found that arginine could increase the solubility of aggregation-prone mutant GFAP by decreasing its ubiquitination and aggregation. Our study suggests a series of pathogenic events leading to AxD, involving interplay between GFAP aggregation and abnormal modifications by GFAP ubiquitination and oxidation. More important, our findings provide a basis for investigating new strategies to treat AxD by targeting abnormal GFAP modifications.",

        "abstract": "While classic brain MR imaging features of Alexander disease have been well-documented, lesional patterns can overlap with other leukodystrophies, especially in the early stages of the disease or in milder phenotypes. We aimed to assess the utility of a new neuroimaging sign to help increase the diagnostic specificity of Alexander disease. A peculiar bilateral symmetric hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images affecting the medulla oblongata was identified in an index patient with type I Alexander disease. Subsequently, 5 observers performed a systematic MR imaging review for this pattern by examining 55 subjects with Alexander disease and 74 subjects with other leukodystrophies. Interobserver agreement was assessed by the \u03ba index. Sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic curves were determined. The identified pattern was present in 87% of subjects with Alexander disease and 14% of those without Alexander disease leukodystrophy (<i>P</i>\u2009<\u2009.001), 3 with vanishing white matter, 4 with adult polyglucosan body disease, and 3 others. It was found equally in both type I and type II Alexander disease (28/32, 88% versus 18/21, 86%; <i>P</i>\u2009=\u2009.851) and in subjects with unusual disease features (2/2). Sensitivity (87.3%; 95% CI, 76.0%-93.7%), specificity (86.5%; 95% CI, 76.9%-92.5%), and interobserver agreement (\u03ba index = 0.82) were high. The identified pattern in the medulla oblongata, called the chipmunk sign due to its resemblance to the face of this rodent, is extremely common in subjects with Alexander disease and represents a diagnostic tool that can aid in early diagnosis, especially in subjects with otherwise atypical MR imaging findings and/or clinical features.",

        "abstract": "Alexander disease (AxD) is a rare inherited autosomal dominant (AD) disease with different clinical phenotypes according to the age of onset. It is caused by mutations in the glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) gene, which causes GFAP accumulation in astrocytes. A wide spectrum of mutations has been described. For some variants, genotype-phenotype correlations have been described, although variable expressivity has also been reported in late-onset cases among members of the same family. We present the case of a 19-year-old girl who developed gait ataxia and subtle involuntary movements, preceded by a history of enuresis and severe scoliosis. Her mother has been affected by ataxia since her childhood, which was then complicated by pyramidal signs and heavily worsened through the years. Beyond her mother, no other known relatives suffered from neurologic syndromes. The scenario was further complicated by a complex brain and spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pattern in both mother and daughter. However, the similar clinical phenotype made an inherited cause highly probable. Both AD and autosomal recessive (AR) ataxic syndromes were considered, lacking a part of the proband's pedigree, but no causative genetic alterations were found. Considering the strong suspicion for an inherited condition, we performed clinical exome sequencing (CES), which analyzes more than 4,500 genes associated with diseases. CES evidenced the new heterozygous missense variant c.260\u2009T\u2009>\u2009A in exon 1 of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) gene (NM_002055.4), which causes the valine to aspartate amino acid substitution at codon 87 (p. Val87Asp) in the GFAP. The same heterozygous variant was detected in her mother. This mutation has never been described before in the literature. This case should raise awareness for this rare and under-recognized disease in juvenile-adult cases.",

However, there is an urgent need for biomarkers to assist in monitoring not only the progression of disease but also the response to treatment. GFAP is the obvious candidate for such a biomarker, as it is measurable in body fluids that are readily accessible for biopsy, namely cerebrospinal fluid and blood. However, in the case of ASOs, the treatment that is furthest in development, GFAP is the target of therapy and presumably would go down independent of disease status. Hence, there is a critical need for biomarkers that are not directly affected by the treatment strategy. We explored the potential utility of biomarkers currently being studied in other neurodegenerative diseases and injuries, specifically neurofilament light protein (NfL), phosphorylated forms of tau, and amyloid-\u03b2 peptides (A\u03b242/40). Here, we report that GFAP is elevated in plasma of all age groups afflicted by AxD, including those with adult onset. NfL and p-tau are also elevated, but to a much lesser extent than GFAP. In contrast, the levels of A\u00df40 and A\u00df42\u00a0are not altered in AxD.",

        "abstract": "Alexander disease (AxD) is a rare neurodegenerative condition that represents the group of leukodystrophies. The disease is caused by <i>GFAP</i> mutation. Symptoms usually occur in the infantile age with macrocephaly, developmental deterioration, progressive quadriparesis, and seizures as the most characteristic features. In this case report, we provide a detailed clinical description of the neonatal type of AxD. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), including a panel of 49 genes related to Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy (EIEE), was carried out, and then Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed on the proband's DNA extracted from blood. In the first weeks of life, the child presented with signs of increased intracranial pressure, which led to ventriculoperitoneal shunt implementation. Recurrent focal-onset motor seizures with secondary generalization occurred despite phenobarbital treatment. Therapy was modified with multiple anti-seizure medications. In MRI contrast-enhanced lesions in basal ganglia, midbrain and cortico-spinal tracts were observed. During the diagnostic process, GLUT-1 deficiency, lysosomal storage disorders, organic acidurias, and fatty acid oxidation defects were excluded. The NGS panel of EIEE revealed no abnormalities. In WES analysis, <i>GFAP</i> missense heterozygous variant NM_002055.5: c.1187C>T, p.(Thr396Ile) was detected, confirming the diagnosis of AxD. AxD should be considered in the differential diagnosis in all neonates with progressive, intractable seizures accompanied by macrocephaly.",

        "abstract": "The majority of the population of glial cells in the central nervous system consists of astrocytes, and impairment of astrocytes causes various disorders. It is useful to assess the multiple astrocytic properties in order to understand their complex roles in the pathophysiology. Although we can differentiate human astrocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), it remains unknown how we can analyse and reveal the multiple properties of astrocytes in complexed human disease conditions. For this purpose, we tested astrocytic differentiation protocols from feeder-free iPSCs based on the previous method with some modifications. Then, we set up extra- and intracellular assessments of iPSC-derived astrocytes by testing cytokine release, calcium influx, autophagy induction and migration. The results led us to analytic methods with conditions in which iPSC-derived astrocytes behave as in\u00a0vivo. Finally, we applied these methods for modelling an astrocyte-related disease, Alexander disease. An analytic system using iPSC-derived astrocytes could be used to recapture complexities in human astrocyte diseases.",

        "title": "Type III intermediate filaments in redox interplay: key role of the conserved cysteine residue.",
        "abstract": "Intermediate filaments (IFs) are cytoskeletal elements involved in mechanotransduction and in the integration of cellular responses. They are versatile structures and their assembly and organization are finely tuned by posttranslational modifications. Among them, type III IFs, mainly vimentin, have been identified as targets of multiple oxidative and electrophilic modifications. A characteristic of most type III IF proteins is the presence in their sequence of a single, conserved cysteine residue (C328 in vimentin), that is a hot spot for these modifications and appears to play a key role in the ability of the filament network to respond to oxidative stress. Current structural models and experimental evidence indicate that this cysteine residue may occupy a strategic position in the filaments in such a way that perturbations at this site, due to chemical modification or mutation, impact filament assembly or organization in a structure-dependent manner. Cysteine-dependent regulation of vimentin can be modulated by interaction with divalent cations, such as zinc, and by pH. Importantly, vimentin remodeling induced by C328 modification may affect its interaction with cellular organelles, as well as the cross-talk between cytoskeletal networks, as seems to be the case for the reorganization of actin filaments in response to oxidants and electrophiles. In summary, the evidence herein reviewed delineates a complex interplay in which type III IFs emerge both as targets and modulators of redox signaling.",

        "title": "Large-scale gene expression changes in APP/PSEN1 and GFAP mutation models exhibit high congruence with Alzheimer's disease.",
        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with both genetic and non-genetic causes. Animal research models are available for a multitude of diseases and conditions affecting the central nervous system (CNS), and large-scale CNS gene expression data exist for many of these. Although there are several models specifically for AD, each recapitulates different aspects of the human disease. In this study we evaluate over 500 animal models to identify those with CNS gene expression patterns matching human AD datasets. Approaches included a hypergeometric based scoring system that rewards congruent gene expression patterns but penalizes discordant gene expression patterns. The top two models identified were APP/PS1 transgenic mice expressing mutant APP and PSEN1, and mice carrying a GFAP mutation that is causative of Alexander disease, a primary disorder of astrocytes in the CNS. The APP/PS1 and GFAP models both matched over 500 genes moving in the same direction as in human AD, and both had elevated GFAP expression and were highly congruent with one another. Also scoring highly were the 5XFAD model (with five mutations in APP and PSEN1) and mice carrying CK-p25, APP, and MAPT mutations. Animals with the APOE3 and 4 mutations combined with traumatic brain injury ranked highly. Bulbectomized rats scored high, suggesting anosmia could be causative of AD-like gene expression. Other matching models included the SOD1G93A strain and knockouts for SNORD116 (Prader-Willi mutation), GRID2, INSM1, XBP1, and CSTB. Many top models demonstrated increased expression of GFAP, and results were similar across multiple human AD datasets. Heatmap and Uniform Manifold Approximation Plot results were consistent with hypergeometric ranking. Finally, some gene manipulation models, including for TYROBP and ATG7, were identified with reversed AD patterns, suggesting possible neuroprotective effects. This study provides insight for the pathobiology of AD and the potential utility of available animal models.",

        "abstract": "Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intracellular type III intermediate filament protein, provides structural support and maintains the mechanical integrity of astrocytes. It is predominantly found in the astrocytes which are the most abundant subtypes of glial cells in the brain and spinal cord. As a marker protein of astrocytes, GFAP may exert a variety of physiological effects in neurological diseases. For example, previous published literatures showed that autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Moreover, the studies of GFAP in brain tumors mainly focus on the predictive value of tumor volume. Furthermore, using biomarkers in the early setting will lead to a simplified and standardized way to estimate the poor outcome in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and ischemic stroke. Recently, observational studies revealed that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GFAP, as a valuable potential diagnostic biomarker for neurosyphilis, had a sensitivity of 76.60% and specificity of 85.56%. The reason plasma GFAP could serve as a promising biomarker for diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is that it effectively distinguished AD dementia from multiple neurodegenerative diseases and predicted the individual risk of AD progression. In addition, GFAP can be helpful in differentiating relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) versus progressive MS (PMS). This review article aims to provide an overview of GFAP in the prediction of clinical progression in neuroinflammation, brain tumors, TBI, ischemic stroke, genetic disorders, neurodegeneration and other diseases in the CNS and to explore the potential therapeutic methods.",

        "abstract": "Alexander disease (AxD) is an intractable neurodegenerative disorder caused by GFAP mutations. It is a primary astrocyte disease with a pathological hallmark of Rosenthal fibres within astrocytes. AxD astrocytes show several abnormal phenotypes. Our previous study showed that AxD astrocytes in model mice exhibit aberrant Ca2+ signals that induce AxD aetiology. Here, we show that microglia have unique phenotypes with morphological and functional alterations, which are related to the pathogenesis of AxD. Immunohistochemical studies of 60TM mice (AxD model) showed that AxD microglia exhibited highly ramified morphology. Functional changes in microglia were assessed by Ca2+ imaging using hippocampal brain slices from Iba1-GCaMP6-60TM mice and two-photon microscopy. We found that AxD microglia showed aberrant Ca2+ signals, with high frequency Ca2+ signals in both the processes and cell bodies. These microglial Ca2+ signals were inhibited by pharmacological blockade or genetic knockdown of P2Y12 receptors but not by tetrodotoxin, indicating that these signals are independent of neuronal activity but dependent on extracellular ATP from non-neuronal cells. Our single-cell RNA sequencing data showed that the expression level of Entpd2, an astrocyte-specific gene encoding the ATP-degrading enzyme NTPDase2, was lower in AxD astrocytes than in wild-type astrocytes. In situ ATP imaging using the adeno-associated virus vector GfaABC1D ATP1.0 showed that exogenously applied ATP was present longer in 60TM mice than in wild-type mice. Thus, the increased ATP level caused by the decrease in its metabolizing enzyme in astrocytes could be responsible for the enhancement of microglial Ca2+ signals. To determine whether these P2Y12 receptor-mediated Ca2+ signals in AxD microglia play a significant role in the pathological mechanism, a P2Y12 receptor antagonist, clopidogrel, was administered. Clopidogrel significantly exacerbated pathological markers in AxD model mice and attenuated the morphological features of microglia, suggesting that microglia play a protective role against AxD pathology via P2Y12 receptors. Taken together, we demonstrated that microglia sense AxD astrocyte dysfunction via P2Y12 receptors as an increase in extracellular ATP and alter their morphology and Ca2+ signalling, thereby protecting against AxD pathology. Although AxD is a primary astrocyte disease, our study may facilitate understanding of the role of microglia as a disease modifier, which may contribute to the clinical diversity of AxD.",

        "abstract": "Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), also known as Stoneman syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal bone development caused by activating mutations of the <i>ACVR1</i> gene. FOP affects both the developmental and postnatal stages, resulting in musculoskeletal abnormalities and heterotopic ossification. Current treatment options for FOP are limited, emphasizing the need for innovative therapeutic approaches. Challenges in the development of management criteria for FOP include difficulties in recruitment due to the rarity of FOP, disease variability, the absence of reliable biomarkers, and ethical considerations regarding placebo-controlled trials. This narrative review provides an overview of the disease and explores emerging strategies for FOP treatment. Gene therapy, particularly the CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9) system, holds promise in treating FOP by specifically targeting the <i>ACVR1</i> gene mutation. Another gene therapy approach being investigated is RNA interference, which aims to silence the mutant <i>ACVR1</i> gene. Small molecule inhibitors targeting glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 and modulation of the bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway are also being explored as potential therapies for FOP. Stem cell-based approaches, such as mesenchymal stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, show potential in tissue regeneration and inhibiting abnormal bone formation in FOP. Immunotherapy and nanoparticle delivery systems provide alternative avenues for FOP treatment.",

        "abstract": "CLN2 and CLN3 diseases, the most common types of Batten disease (also known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis), are childhood dementias associated with progressive loss of speech, language and feeding skills. Here we delineate speech, language, non-verbal communication and feeding phenotypes in 33 individuals (19 females) with a median age of 9.5\u2009years (range 3-28\u2009years); 16 had CLN2 and 17 CLN3 disease; 8/15 (53%) participants with CLN2 and 8/17 (47%) participants with CLN3 disease had speech and language impairments prior to genetic diagnosis. At the time of study all participants, bar one, had language impairments. The remaining participant with typical language was tested at age 3\u2009years, following pre-symptomatic enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) from age 9\u2009months. CLN2 and CLN3 disease had different profiles. For CLN2 disease, all affected individuals showed language impairment with dysarthria; older individuals with classical disease progressively became non-verbal. For CLN3 disease, the presentation was more heterogeneous. Speech impairment was evident early in the disease course, with dysarthria (13/15, 87%), often manifesting as neurogenic stuttering (5/15, 33%). Participants with CLN2 disease had comparable expressive and receptive language skills (p\u2009>\u20090.99), yet participants with CLN3 disease had stronger expressive language than receptive language skills (p\u2009=\u20090.004). Speech, cognitive and language impairment and adaptive behaviour showed progressive decline in both diseases. Individuals with pre-symptomatic ERT or atypical CLN2 disease were less impaired. Challenging behaviours were common in CLN3 (11/17, 65%), but less frequent in CLN2 (4/16, 25%) disease. Individuals with Batten disease require tailored speech therapy incorporating communication partner training utilising environment adaptations and informal communication behaviours.",

        "abstract": "CLN8-Batten disease is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized phenotypically by progressive deterioration of motor and cognitive abilities, visual symptoms, epileptic seizures, and premature death. Mutations in CLN8 result in characteristic Batten disease symptoms and brain-wide pathology including accumulation of lysosomal storage material, gliosis, and neurodegeneration. Recent investigations of other subtypes of Batten disease (CLN1, CLN3, CLN6) have emphasized the influence of biological sex on disease and treatment outcomes; however, little is known about sex differences in the CLN8 subtype. To determine the impact of sex on CLN8 disease burden and progression, a Cln8mnd mouse model was utilized to measure the impact and progression of histopathological and motor-behavioral outcomes between sexes. Immunohistochemistry staining utilized markers for intracellular storage materials, astrocytes, and microglial cells; sections were obtained of the thalamus and the somatosensory cortex of Cln8mnd mice. Several notable sex differences were observed in the presentation of brain pathology, including Cln8mnd female mice consistently presenting with greater GFAP+ astrocytosis and CD68+ microgliosis in the somatosensory cortex and ventral posteromedial/ventral posterolateral nuclei of the thalamus when compared to Cln8mnd male mice. Female Cln8mnd mice experienced a diminished lifespan by 0.5 months compared to their male counterparts (p less than 0.05). Furthermore, sex differences in motor-behavioral assessments identified Cln8mnd female mice experience poorer motor performance in the Morris Water Maze assessment, reverse Morris Water Maze, and increased tremors. Female Cln8mnd mice perished earlier, performed worse on motor-behavioral assessments, and demonstrated marked microglial and astrocyte reactivity compared to their male counterparts. Taken together, the results provide further evidence of biological sex as a modifier of Batten disease progression and outcome, thus warranting consideration when conducting investigations and monitoring therapeutic impact.",

        "abstract": "The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are incurable pediatric neurodegenerative diseases characterized by accumulation of lysosomal material and dysregulation of autophagy. Given the promising results of treatment with trehalose, an autophagy inducer, in cell and animal models of NCL, we conducted an open-label, non-placebo-controlled, non-randomized 12-month prospective study in NCL patients receiving oral trehalose (4\u00a0g/day). All were treated with a commercially available formulation for 6\u00a0months, followed by a 6-month washout. The primary endpoint was the presence of severe adverse reactions during treatment; secondary endpoints were clinical changes documented using the validated Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale and the Hamburg scale. Leveraging on our recent multiomic studies identifying convergent biomarkers in NCLs, fluid biomarker changes were taken as additional secondary endpoints. Of the 17 patients enrolled, 11 completed the study. Oral intake of trehalose in NCL patients with different genetic forms and at different disease stages was found to be well tolerated over 6\u00a0months. Oral trehalose is associated with subjective benefits reported by caregivers, but not with improvement or worsening on clinical scales. Analysis of potential biomarkers demonstrated significant differences between patients and controls at baseline, but we observed no modifications over time, or correlations with clinical scales and treatment. In our pilot experience in a heterogeneous disease group of NCL, oral trehalose seemed safe for patients. While subjective improvements were reported by caregivers, larger multicenter randomized placebo-controlled studies, and perhaps additional clinical tools covering multiple functions affected by the disease, will be needed to identify possible improvements in clinical scale scores and biomarkers.",

        "abstract": "This study evaluated the clinical characteristics of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 7 or CLN7 disease spectrum to characterize the clinical, electrophysiologic and neuroimaging phenotypes. We performed a single-center cross sectional data collection along with retrospective medical chart review in patients with a genetic diagnosis of CLN7. This study received ethical approval by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Review Board. A total of 8 patients were included between the ages of 4 to 6 years. All patients had a genetic diagnosis of CLN7 with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the MFSD8 gene. The information collected includes patient demographics, developmental history, neurological events including seizures and neurodevelopmental regression along with further evaluation of brain magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological findings. The clinical phenotype is described through cross sectional and retrospective data collection and standardized tools assessing quality of life and functional skills. Our findings in this cohort of CLN7 patients indicated that development is initially normal with onset of clinical symptoms as early as two years of age. Language problems were noted prior to or at the onset of seizures in all cases. Gait problems were noted prior to seizure onset in 3 of 8 patients, and at or within 6 months after the onset of seizures in 5 of 8 patients. All patients followed a progressive course of language, motor, and neurocognitive deterioration. Congruent with the medical history, our patients had significantly low scores on adaptive abilities. Natural history data such as this can be used to support future clinical trial designs. This study provides a comprehensive description of CLN7 disease, highlighting clinical data alongside standardized neuropsychological assessments, neuroimaging, and electrophysiologic data. It emphasizes the value of importance of standardized tools for understanding disease phenotype and their potential use as endpoints in future clinical trials. The findings established can provide a baseline for developing future prospective natural history studies and potential therapeutic clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, commonly known as Batten disease, are a group of lysosomal storage disorders affecting children. There is extensive central nervous system and retinal degeneration, resulting in seizures, vision loss and a progressive cognitive and motor decline. Enzyme replacement and gene therapies are being developed, and mRNA and oligonucleotide therapies are more recently being considered. Overcoming the challenges of the blood-brain barrier and blood-ocular barrier is crucial for effectively targeting the brain and eye, whatever the therapeutic approach. Nanoparticles and extracellular vesicles are small carriers that can encapsulate a cargo and pass through these cell barriers. They have been investigated as drug carriers for other pathologies and could be a promising treatment strategy for Batten disease. Their use in gene, enzyme, or mRNA replacement therapy of all lysosomal storage disorders, including Mucopolysaccharidoses, Niemann-Pick diseases, and Fabry disease, is investigated in this systematic review. Different nanocarriers can efficiently target the lysosome and cross the barriers into the brain and eyes. This supports continued exploration of nanocarriers as potential future treatment options for Batten disease.",

        "abstract": "Bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) is a major phospholipid constituent of intralumenal membranes in late endosomes/lysosomes, where it regulates the degradation and sorting of lipid cargo. Recent observations suggest that the Batten disease-associated protein CLN5 functions as lysosomal BMP synthase. Here, we show that transacylation reactions catalyzed by cytosolic and secreted enzymes enhance BMP synthesis independently of CLN5. The transacylases identified in this study are capable of acylating the precursor lipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG), generating acyl-PG, which is subsequently hydrolyzed to BMP. Extracellularly, acyl-PG and BMP are generated by endothelial lipase in cooperation with other serum enzymes of the pancreatic lipase family. The intracellular acylation of PG is catalyzed by several members of the cytosolic phospholipase A2 group IV (PLA2G4) family. Overexpression of secreted or cytosolic transacylases was sufficient to correct BMP deficiency in HEK293 cells lacking CLN5. Collectively, our observations suggest that functionally overlapping pathways promote BMP synthesis in mammalian cells.",

        "abstract": "CLN3 Batten disease (also known as juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a lysosomal storage disorder that typically initiates with retinal degeneration but is followed by seizure onset, motor decline and premature death. Patient-derived CLN3 disease induced pluripotent stem cell-RPE cells show defective phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segment (POS). Because modifier genes are implicated in CLN3 disease, our goal here was to investigate a direct link between CLN3 mutation and POS phagocytosis defect. Isogenic control and CLN3 mutant stem cell lines were generated by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated biallelic deletion of exons 7 and 8. A transgenic CLN3\u03947-8/\u03947-8 (CLN3) Yucatan miniswine was also used to study the impact of CLN3\u03947-8/\u03947-8 mutation on POS phagocytosis. POS phagocytosis by cultured RPE cells was analyzed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Electroretinogram, optical coherence tomography and histological analysis of CLN3\u03947-8/\u03947-8 and wild-type miniswine eyes were carried out at 6, 36, or 48 months of age. CLN3\u03947-8/\u03947-8 RPE (CLN3 RPE) displayed decreased POS binding and consequently decreased uptake of POS compared with isogenic control RPE cells. Furthermore, wild-type miniswine RPE cells phagocytosed CLN3\u03947-8/\u03947-8 POS less efficiently than wild-type POS. Consistent with decreased POS phagocytosis, lipofuscin/autofluorescence was decreased in CLN3 miniswine RPE at 36\u00a0months of age and was followed by almost complete loss of photoreceptors at 48\u00a0months of age. CLN3\u03947-8/\u03947-8 mutation (which affects \u226485% of patients) affects both RPE and POS and leads to photoreceptor cell loss in CLN3 disease. Furthermore, both primary RPE dysfunction and mutant POS independently contribute to impaired POS phagocytosis in CLN3 disease.",

        "abstract": "Ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal (CLN) encompasses rare inherited neurodegenerative disorders that present in childhood with clinical features including epilepsy, psychomotor delay, progressive vision loss, and premature death. Published experience utilizing umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT) for these disorders is limited. This retrospective analysis includes patients with CLN (2, 3, and 5) who underwent UCBT from 2012 to 2020. All subjects (n\u2005=\u20058) received standard-of-care myeloablative conditioning. Four also enrolled in clinical trial NCT02254863 and received intrathecal DUOC-01 cells posttransplant. Median age at UCBT was 5.9 years. All subjects achieved neutrophil engraftment with >95% donor chimerism at a median of 28.5 days. Sinusoidal obstructive syndrome was not observed. Severe acute graft-versus-host disease occurred in 12.5%. Other complications included autoimmune hemolytic anemia (25%) and viral reactivation/infection (62.5%). No transplant-related mortality was observed. Two CLN2 patients died, 1 from progressive disease and 1 from unknown cause at days +362 and +937, respectively. With median follow-up of 8 years, overall survival at 100 days and 24 months was 100% and 88%, respectively. Three of 4 CLN3 subjects stabilized Hamburg motor and language scores. While UCBT appears safe and feasible in these patients, given the variable expression and natural history, extended follow-up and further studies are needed to elucidate the potential impact of UCBT on clinical outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Loss-of-function mutations in CLN3 cause juvenile Batten disease, featuring neurodegeneration and early-stage neuroinflammation. How loss of CLN3 function leads to early neuroinflammation is not yet understood. Here, we have comprehensively studied microglia from Cln3<sup>\u2206ex7/8</sup> mice, a genetically accurate disease model. Loss of CLN3 function in microglia leads to lysosomal storage material accumulation and abnormal morphology of subcellular organelles. Moreover, pathological proteomic signatures are indicative of defects in lysosomal function and abnormal lipid metabolism. Consistent with these findings, CLN3-deficient microglia are unable to efficiently turnover myelin and metabolize the associated lipids, showing defects in lipid droplet formation and cholesterol accumulation. Accordingly, we also observe impaired myelin integrity in aged Cln3<sup>\u2206ex7/8</sup> mouse brain. Autophagy inducers and cholesterol-lowering drugs correct the observed microglial phenotypes. Taken together, these data implicate a cell-autonomous defect in CLN3-deficient microglia that impacts their ability to support neuronal cell health, suggesting microglial targeted therapies should be considered for CLN3 disease.",

        "abstract": "Batten disease is a group of rare inherited neurodegenerative diseases. Juvenile CLN3 disease is the most prevalent type, and the most common pathogenic variant shared by most patients is the \"1-kb\" deletion which removes two internal coding exons (7 and 8) in CLN3. Previously, we identified two transcripts in patient fibroblasts homozygous for the 1-kb deletion: the 'major' and 'minor' transcripts. To understand the full variety of disease transcripts and their role in disease pathogenesis, it is necessary to first investigate CLN3 transcription in \"healthy\" samples without juvenile CLN3 disease. We leveraged PacBio long-read RNA sequencing datasets from ENCODE to investigate the full range of CLN3 transcripts across various tissues and cell types in human control samples. Then we sought to validate their existence using data from different sources. We found that a readthrough gene affects the quantification and annotation of CLN3. After taking this into account, we detected over 100 novel CLN3 transcripts, with no dominantly expressed CLN3 transcript. The most abundant transcript has median usage of 42.9%. Surprisingly, the known disease-associated 'major' transcripts are detected. Together, they have median usage of 1.5% across 22 samples. Furthermore, we identified 48 CLN3 ORFs, of which 26 are novel. The predominant ORF that encodes the canonical CLN3 protein isoform has median usage of 66.7%, meaning around one-third of CLN3 transcripts encode protein isoforms with different stretches of amino acids. The same ORFs could be found with alternative UTRs. Moreover, we were able to validate the translational potential of certain transcripts using public mass spectrometry data. Overall, these findings provide valuable insights into the complexity of CLN3 transcription, highlighting the importance of studying both canonical and non-canonical CLN3 protein isoforms as well as the regulatory role of UTRs to fully comprehend the regulation and function(s) of CLN3. This knowledge is essential for investigating the impact of the 1-kb deletion and rare pathogenic variants on CLN3 transcription and disease pathogenesis.",

To address this gap, we conducted a descriptive case analysis of BPSD profiles, associated contributing factors and targeted psychosocial interventions in two cases with childhood dementia disorders (Sanfilippo syndrome and CLN3 (juvenile onset) Batten disease) who were referred to Dementia Support Australia, a national dementia behaviour support service in Australia. Primary BPSD identified in these disorders included physical and verbal aggression and irritability/lability. In these cases, contributing factors to the development of BPSD were not monolithic, encompassing pain, caregiver's approach and over or under-stimulation. Improvement in BPSD were observed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Quesionnaire and globally noted as per the qualitative feedback reported by family and caregivers. Person-centred, multimodal psychosocial interventions were recognised as effective therapies in resolving BPSD in these cases. In conclusion, the case studies described the nature and presentation of BPSD in two common forms of childhood dementia and demonstrated the potential benefits of person-centred psychosocial interventions (delivered through national dementia-specific support programs) in alleviating BPSD such as irritability and aggression in these disorders.",

        "abstract": "Infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN1 Batten Disease) is a devastating pediatric lysosomal storage disease caused by pathogenic variants in the CLN1 gene, which encodes the depalmitoylation enzyme, palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1). CLN1 patients present with visual deterioration, psychomotor dysfunction, and recurrent seizures until neurodegeneration results in death, typically before fifteen years of age. Histopathological features of CLN1 include aggregation of lysosomal autofluorescent storage material (AFSM), as well as profound gliosis. The current management of CLN1 is relegated to palliative care. Here, we examine the therapeutic potential of a small molecule PPT1 mimetic, N-tert-butyl hydroxylamine (NtBuHA), in a Cln1<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model. Treatment with NtBuHA reduced AFSM accumulation both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, NtBuHA treatment in Cln1<sup>-/-</sup> mice reduced neuroinflammation, mitigated epileptic episodes, and normalized motor function. Live cell imaging of Cln1<sup>-/-</sup> primary cortical neurons treated with NtBuHA partially rescued aberrant synaptic calcium dynamics, suggesting a potential mechanism contributing to the therapeutic effects of NtBuHA in vivo. Taken together, our findings provide supporting evidence for NtBuHA as a potential treatment for CLN1 Batten Disease.",

We performed a single-center cross sectional data collection along with retrospective medical chart review in patients with a genetic diagnosis of CLN7. This study received ethical approval by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Review Board. A total of 8 patients were included between the ages of 4 to 6 years. All patients had a genetic diagnosis of CLN7 with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the <i>MFSD8</i> gene. The information collected includes patient demographics, developmental history, neurological events including seizures and neurodevelopmental regression along with further evaluation of brain magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological findings. The clinical phenotype is described through cross sectional and retrospective data collection and standardized tools assessing quality of life and functional skills. Our findings in this cohort of CLN7 patients indicated that development is initially normal with onset of clinical symptoms as early as two years of age. Language problems were noted prior to or at the onset of seizures in all cases. Gait problems were noted prior to seizure onset in 3 of 8 patients, and at or within 6 months after the onset of seizures in 5 of 8 patients. All patients followed a progressive course of language, motor, and neurocognitive deterioration. Congruent with the medical history, our patients had significantly low scores on adaptive abilities. Natural history data such as this can be used to support future clinical trial designs.",

        "abstract": "Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2-disease) is an inherited childhood-onset neurodegenerative condition, with classical early features of speech delay, epilepsy, myoclonus, ataxia, and motor regression. This study aimed to better characterize the spectrum of movement disorders in CLN2-disease in a cohort of children receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). A cohort of 18 children attending a single center for treatment with cerliponase alfa ERT was systematically assessed using a standardized structured history and a double-scored, video-recorded examination using the Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale (UBDRS) and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. Noncanonical movement disorders are common: while ataxia (89%) and myoclonus (83%) were near-universal, spasticity and dystonia were experienced by over half (61% each), with children having a median of 4 distinct movement disorder phenotypes. This progression was stereotyped with initial ataxia/myoclonus, then hyperkinesia/spasticity, and later hypokinesia. ERT slows progression of movement disorders, as measured by the UBDRS physical subscale, with 1.45 points-per-month progression before diagnosis and 0.44 points-per-month while on treatment (<i>p</i> = 0.019). Movement disorders are a core feature of CLN2-disease and follow a typical pattern of progression which is slowed by ERT. Identifying and treating movement disorders should become standard, especially given increased patient survival.",

        "abstract": "Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are single stranded nucleic acids that target RNA. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved ASOs for several diseases. ASOs utilize three principal modes of action (MOA). The first MOA is initiated by base-pairing between the ASO and its target mRNA, followed by RNase H-dependent mRNA degradation. The second MOA is triggered by ASOs that occlude splice acceptor sites in pre-mRNAs leading to skipping of a mutation-bearing exon. The third MOA involves ASOs that sterically hinder mRNA function, often inhibiting translation. ASOs contain a variety of modifications to the sugar-phosphate backbone and bases that stabilize the ASO or render them resistant to RNase activity. RNase H-dependent ASOs include inotersen and eplontersen (for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis), fomiversen (for opportunistic cytomegalovirus infection), mipomersen (for familial hypercholesterolemia), and tofersen [for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)]. Splice modulating ASOs include nursinersen (for spinal muscular atrophy) and eteplirsen, golodirsen, viltolarsen, and casimersen (all for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy). In addition, a designer ASO, milasen, was used to treat a single individual afflicted with Batten disease. Since ASO design relies principally upon knowledge of mRNA sequence, the bench to bedside pipeline for ASOs is expedient compared with protein-directed drugs.\u00a0[Graphical abstract available.].",

        "abstract": "CLN3 Batten disease (also known as Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis; JNCL) is a lysosomal storage disorder that typically initiates with retinal degeneration but is followed by seizure onset, motor decline and premature death. Patient-derived CLN3 disease iPSC-RPE cells show defective phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POSs). Because modifier genes are implicated in CLN3 disease, our goal here was to investigate a direct link between <i>CLN3</i> mutation and POS phagocytosis defect. Isogenic control and <i>CLN3</i> mutant stem cell lines were generated by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated biallelic deletion of exons 7 and 8. A transgenic <i>CLN3</i> <sup>\u0394</sup> <i><sup>7-8/</sup></i> <sup>\u0394</sup> <i><sup>7-8</sup></i> ( <i>CLN3</i> ) Yucatan miniswine was also used to study the impact of <i>CLN3</i> <sup>\u0394</sup> <i><sup>7-8/</sup></i> <sup>\u0394</sup> <i><sup>7-8</sup></i> mutation on POS phagocytosis. POS phagocytosis by cultured RPE cells was analyzed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Electroretinogram, optical coherence tomography and histological analysis of <i>CLN3</i> <sup>\u0394</sup> <i><sup>7/8</sup></i> and wild-type miniswine eyes were carried out at 6-, 36-, or 48-month age. <i>CLN3</i> <sup>\u0394</sup> <i><sup>7-8/</sup></i> <sup>\u0394</sup> <i><sup>7-8</sup></i> RPE ( <i>CLN3</i> RPE) displayed reduced POS binding and consequently decreased uptake of POS compared to isogenic control RPE cells.

Consistent with decreased POS phagocytosis, lipofuscin/autofluorescence was decreased in <i>CLN3</i> miniswine RPE at 36 months-of-age and was followed by almost complete loss of photoreceptors at 48 months of age. <i>CLN3</i> <sup>\u0394</sup> <i><sup>7-8/</sup></i> <sup>\u0394</sup> <i><sup>7-8</sup></i> mutation (that affects up to 85% patients) affects both RPE and POSs and leads to photoreceptor cell loss in CLN3 disease.

        "abstract": "Batten disease is characterized by early-onset blindness, juvenile dementia and death during the second decade of life. The most common genetic causes are mutations in the <i>CLN3</i> gene encoding a lysosomal protein. There are currently no therapies targeting the progression of the disease, mostly due to the lack of knowledge about the disease mechanisms. To gain insight into the impact of CLN3 loss on cellular signaling and organelle function, we generated CLN3 knock-out cells in a human cell line (CLN3-KO), and performed RNA sequencing to obtain the cellular transcriptome. Following a multi-dimensional transcriptome analysis, we identified the transcriptional regulator YAP1 as a major driver of the transcriptional changes observed in CLN3-KO cells. We further observed that YAP1 pro-apoptotic signaling is hyperactive as a consequence of CLN3 functional loss in retinal pigment epithelia cells, and in the hippocampus and thalamus of CLN3<sup>ex\u03947/8</sup> mice, an established model of Batten disease. Loss of CLN3 activates YAP1 by a cascade of events that starts with the inability of releasing glycerophosphodiesthers from CLN3-KO lysosomes, which leads to perturbations in the lipid content of the nuclear envelope and nuclear dysmorphism. This results in increased number of DNA lesions, activating the kinase c-Abl, which phosphorylates YAP1, stimulating its pro-apoptotic signaling. Altogether, our results highlight a novel organelle crosstalk paradigm in which lysosomal metabolites regulate nuclear envelope content, nuclear shape and DNA homeostasis. This novel molecular mechanism underlying the loss of CLN3 in mammalian cells and tissues may open new c-Abl-centric therapeutic strategies to target Batten disease.",

        "abstract": "Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) are among the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders of early life in humans. Disease-causing variants have been described for 13 different NCL genes. In this study, a refined pathological characterization of a female rabbit with progressive neurological signs reminiscent of NCL was performed. Cytoplasmic pigment present in neurons was weakly positive with Sudan black B and autofluorescent. Immunohistology revealed astrogliosis, microgliosis and axonal degeneration. During the subsequent genetic investigation, the genome of the affected rabbit was sequenced and examined for private variants in NCL candidate genes. The analysis revealed a homozygous ~10.7\u2009kb genomic duplication on chromosome 15 comprising parts of the MFSD8 gene, NC_013683.1:g.103,727,963_103,738,667dup. The duplication harbors two internal protein coding exons and is predicted to introduce a premature stop codon into the transcript, truncating ~50% of the wild-type MFSD8 open reading frame encoding the major facilitator superfamily domain containing protein 8, XP_002717309.2:p.(Glu235Leufs*23). Biallelic loss-of-function variants in MFSD8 have been described to cause NCL7 in human patients, dogs and a single cat. The available clinical and pathological data, together with current knowledge about MFSD8 variants and their functional impact in other species, point to the MFSD8 duplication as a likely causative defect for the observed phenotype in the affected rabbit.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in the CLN6 gene cause late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease of childhood onset. Clinically, individuals present with progressive motor and cognitive regression, ataxia, and early death. The aim of this study is to establish natural history data of individuals with classic, late-infantile-onset (age less than five years) CLN6 disease. We analyzed the natural history of 25 patients with late-infantile-onset CLN6, utilizing the Hamburg motor-language scale to measure disease progression. The key outcomes were CLN6 disease progression, assessed by rate of decline in motor and language clinical domain summary scores (0 to 6 total points); onset and type of first symptom; onset of first seizure; and time from first symptom to complete loss of function. Median age of total motor and language onset of decline was 42\u00a0months (interquartile range 36 to 48). The estimated rate of decline in total score was at a slope of\u00a0-1.20 (S.D. 0.30) per year, after the start of decline. Complete loss of both motor and language function was found to be, on average, 88.1\u00a0months (S.D. 13.5). To our knowledge, this is the largest international study that monitors the longitudinal natural history and progression of CLN6 disease. These data may serve as a template for future interventional trials targeted to slow the progression of this devastating disease.",

        "title": "A recessive <i>CLN3</i> variant is responsible for delayed-onset retinal degeneration in Hereford cattle.",
        "abstract": "Thirteen American Hereford cattle were reported blind with presumed onset when ~12-mo-old. All blind cattle shared a common ancestor through both the maternal and paternal pedigrees, suggesting a recessive genetic origin. Given the pedigree relationships and novel phenotype, we characterized the ophthalmo-pathologic changes associated with blindness and identified the responsible gene variant. Ophthalmologic examinations of 5 blind cattle revealed retinal degeneration. Histologically, 2 blind cattle had loss of the retinal photoreceptor layer. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 7 blind cattle and 9 unaffected relatives revealed a 1-bp frameshift deletion in ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal 3 (<i>CLN3</i>; chr25 g.26043843del) for which the blind cattle were homozygous and their parents heterozygous. The identified variant in exon 16 of 17 is predicted to truncate the encoded protein (p. Pro369Argfs*8) battenin, which is involved in lysosomal function necessary for photoreceptor layer maintenance. Of 462 cattle genotyped, only blind cattle were homozygous for the deletion. A query of WGS data of >\u20095,800 animals further revealed that the variant was only observed in related Hereford cattle. Mutations in <i>CLN3</i> are associated with human juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL), or Batten disease, which results in early-onset retinal degeneration and lesions similar to those observed in our cases. Our data support the frameshift variant of <i>CLN3</i> as causative of blindness in these Hereford cattle, and provide additional evidence of the role of this gene in retinal lesions, possibly as a model for human non-syndromic JNCL.",

        "abstract": "CLN3 disease (also known as CLN3 Batten disease or Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric neurodegenerative disorder caused by biallelic mutations in CLN3. While extensive efforts have been undertaken to understand CLN3 disease etiology, pathology, and clinical progression, little is known about the impact of CLN3 disease on parents and caregivers. Here, we investigated CLN3 disease progression, clinical care, and family experiences using semi-structured interviews with 39 parents of individuals with CLN3 disease. Analysis included response categorization by independent observers and quantitative methods. Parents reported patterns of disease progression that aligned with previous reports. Insomnia and thought- and mood-related concerns were reported frequently. \"Decline in visual acuity\" was the first sign/symptom noticed by n\u2009=\u200928 parents (70%). A minority of parents reported \"behavioral issues\" (n\u2009=\u20095, 12.5%), \"communication issues\" (n\u2009=\u20093, 7.5%), \"cognitive decline\" (n\u2009=\u20091, 2.5%), or \"seizures\" (n\u2009=\u20091, 2.5%) as the first sign/symptom. The mean time from the first signs or symptoms to a diagnosis of CLN3 disease was 2.8 years (SD\u2009=\u20094.1). Misdiagnosis was common, being reported by n\u2009=\u200924 participants (55.8%). Diagnostic tests and treatments were closely aligned with observed symptoms. Desires for improved or stabilized vision (top therapeutic treatment concern for n\u2009=\u200914, 32.6%), cognition (n\u2009=\u20098, 18.6%), and mobility (n\u2009=\u20093, 7%) dominated parental concerns and wishes for therapeutic correction. Family impacts were common, with n\u2009=\u200934 (81%) of respondents reporting a financial impact on the family and n\u2009=\u200920 (46.5%) reporting marital strain related to the disease. Collectively, responses demonstrated clear patterns of disease progression, a strong desire for therapies to treat symptoms related to vision and cognition, and a powerful family impact driven by the unrelenting nature of disease progression.",

        "abstract": "Palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) is an understudied enzyme that is gaining attention due to its role in the depalmitoylation of several proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. PPT1 is overexpressed in several cancers, specifically cholangiocarcinoma and esophageal cancers. Inhibitors of PPT1 lead to cell death and have been shown to enhance the killing of tumor cells alongside known chemotherapeutics. PPT1 is hence a viable target for anticancer drug development. Furthermore, mutations in PPT1 cause a lysosomal storage disorder called infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN1 disease). Molecules that can inhibit, stabilize, or modulate the activity of this target are needed to address these diseases. We used PPT1 enzymatic assays to identify molecules that were subsequently tested by using differential scanning fluorimetry and microscale thermophoresis. Selected compounds were also tested in neuroblastoma cell lines. The resulting PPT1 screening data was used for building machine learning models to help select additional compounds for testing. We discovered two of the most potent PPT1 inhibitors reported to date, orlistat (IC<sub>50</sub> 178.8 nM) and palmostatin B (IC<sub>50</sub> 11.8 nM). When tested in HepG2 cells, it was found that these molecules had decreased activity, indicating that they were likely not penetrating the cells. The combination of in vitro enzymatic and biophysical assays enabled the identification of several molecules that can bind or inhibit PPT1 and may aid in the discovery of modulators or chaperones. The molecules identified could be used as a starting point for further optimization as treatments for other potential therapeutic applications outside CLN1 disease, such as cancer and neurological diseases.",

        "abstract": "Late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2), is a neurodegenerative autosomal recessive disease caused by <i>TPP1</i> gene variants<i>,</i> with a spectrum of classic and atypical phenotypes. The aim of treatment is to slow functional decline as early as possible in an attempt to improve quality of life and survival. This study describes the clinical characteristics as well as the response to treatment with cerliponase alfa. A retrospective study was conducted in five Latin-American countries, using clinical records from patients with CLN2. Clinical follow-up and treatment variables are described. A descriptive and bivariate statistical analysis was performed. A total of 36 patients were observed (range of follow-up of 61-110\u00a0weeks post-treatment). At presentation, patients with the classic phenotype (<i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a016) exhibited regression in language (90%), while seizures were the predominant symptom (87%) in patients with the atypical phenotype (<i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a020). Median age of symptom onset and time to first specialized consultation was 3 (classical) and 7 (atypical) years, while the median time interval between onset of symptoms and treatment initiation was 4\u00a0years (classical) and 7.5 (atypical). The most frequent variant was c.827\u00a0A\u00a0>\u00a0T in 17/72 alleles, followed by c.622C\u00a0>\u00a0T in 6/72 alleles. All patients were treated with cerliponase alfa, and either remained functionally stable or had a loss of 1 point on the CLN2 scale, or up to 2 points on the Wells Cornel and Hamburg scales, when compared to pretreatment values. This study reports the largest number of patients with CLN2 currently on treatment with cerliponase alfa in the world. Data show a higher frequency of patients with atypical phenotypes and a high allelic proportion of intron variants in our region. There was evidence of long intervals until first specialized consultation, diagnosis, and enzyme replacement therapy. Follow-up after the initiation of cerliponase alfa showed slower progression or stabilization of the disease, associated with adequate clinical outcomes and stable functional scores. These improvements were consistent in both clinical phenotypes.",

        "abstract": "Batten disease, the most prevalent form of neurodegeneration in children, is caused by mutations in the CLN3 gene, which encodes a lysosomal transmembrane protein. CLN3 loss leads to significant accumulation of glycerophosphodiesters (GPDs), the end products of glycerophospholipid catabolism in the lysosome. Despite GPD storage being robustly observed upon CLN3 loss, the role of GPDs in neuropathology remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that GPDs act as potent inhibitors of glycerophospholipid catabolism in the lysosome using human cell lines and mouse models. Mechanistically, GPDs bind and competitively inhibit the lysosomal phospholipases PLA2G15 and PLBD2, which we establish to possess phospholipase B activity. GPDs effectively inhibit the rate-limiting lysophospholipase activity of these\u00a0phospholipases. Consistently, lysosomes of CLN3-deficient cells and tissues accumulate toxic lysophospholipids. Our work establishes that the storage material in Batten disease directly disrupts lysosomal lipid homeostasis, suggesting GPD clearance as a potential therapeutic approach to this fatal disease.",

Limited studies have been done to explore the molecular pathophysiology of the disease, with rather limited studies involving transcriptomic analyzes.

Transcriptomic data analysis of publicly available data was done followed by WGCNA to identify shared signature gene modules. The Maximal Clique Centrality algorithm was applied to gene modules, and unclustered network analysis was conducted on differentially expressed genes to identify true hub genes. The expression of candidate genes in various cancer types was analyzed using GEPIA. WGCNA analysis identified five significant modules, with the most enriched module being associated with angiogenesis and cell junction regulators. The intersection of true hub genes from MCC analysis of WGCNA modules and high-degree nodes from an unclustered network revealed eight consistently overexpressed genes in all angiosarcoma samples.Among the eight enriched genes, CHRNA5 and CTLA4, are exclusively overexpressed in angiosarcoma and not in other cancers of the same tissue origin, with significant drug-protein interactions suggesting their potential as therapeutic targets.",

        "abstract": "Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous group of tumors with diverse clinical and molecular characteristics, characterized by limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as promising therapies for STS, yet comprehensive evaluations of their efficacy, especially in combination with other treatments, are scarce. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials on ICIs in STS treatment, sourced from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to May 31, 2024. The studies included both monotherapy and combination therapies with ICIs. We assessed the methodological quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool and the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies. Data synthesis involved random-effects meta-analysis to determine pooled proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for objective response rates (ORR), disease control rates (DCR), and high-grade treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). The analysis included 38 studies with 1349 patients covering 24 STS subtypes. The overall ORR was 16% (95% CI 0.12-0.21), DCR was 64% (95% CI 0.57-0.70), and the rate of Grade 3-5 TRAEs was 19% (95% CI 0.13-0.27). Treatments combining ICIs with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) showed the highest efficacy (ORR 28%, 95% CI 0.18-0.40), albeit with increased adverse events. ORRs in first-line treatments were substantially higher (28%) compared to second-line treatments or beyond (11%). Subtypes like alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), angiosarcoma (AS), and epithelioid sarcoma (ES) exhibited favorable responses exceeding 30%. This systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that ICIs, particularly when combined with TKIs, provide substantial therapeutic benefits in treating STS, significantly enhancing response rates in specific subtypes such as ASPS and AS. The results underscore the transformative potential of ICIs in STS treatment strategies. However, the variability across subtypes and treatment lines emphasizes the need for further randomized controlled trials to refine and personalize therapeutic approaches, ensuring optimal outcomes for patients with these diverse malignancies.",

        "abstract": "Retiform hemangioendothelioma(RH) is a rare vascular tumor affecting patients over a wide age range without a gender predilection; only about 50 cases have been described so far. We report a case of submandibular retiform hemangioendothelioma in a 58-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with RH 20\u00a0years ago and had experienced recurrence four times during the past 20\u00a0years. This will increase the limited number of such cases in the hope of gaining a better understanding of this rare type of tumor. The histological features of RH are characterized by arborizing blood vessels arranged in a testicular network pattern with endothelial cells arranged in a hobnail pattern. Immunohistochemistry revealed CD31, CD34, ERG, and other vascular markers. Based on the morphological and immunohistochemical results, we diagnosed the patient with a rectiform hemangioendothelioma with local malignancy that transformed into angiosarcoma, with enlargement of the lymph nodes in the neck area, possibly indicating tumor lymph node metastasis. The patient underwent extended resection and completed 14 radiotherapy sessions. Follow-up at 3\u00a0months after surgery showed no recurrence. RH is a low-grade malignant intermediate vascular tumor that is prone to recurrence and does not generally metastasize to distant sites. Patients with recurrent relapses may undergo malignant transformation or lymph node metastases. Treatment primarily relies on wide excision and adjuvant radiotherapy may be necessary when required.",

        "abstract": "Angiosarcoma (AS) is a rare, aggressive malignancy originating from vascular or lymphatic endothelial cells. Despite its severity, little is known about its epidemiology, and no geographical regions have previously been identified as having an exceptionally high incidence. We retrospectively analyzed medical records spanning 37\u2009years (1987-2023) in Okinawa, Japan, identifying 135 cases of AS that were used to calculate its incidence. This incidence was compared to global data to highlight significant regional differences. Factors related to patients' survival were also assessed. The age-adjusted incidence of AS of the scalp in Okinawa was 4.1 per million per year (mpy; 2015 Japanese model population) or 2.0 per mpy (2000 US standard population), significantly higher than the global data, including in the United States (about eightfold higher) and mainland Japan (about fourfold higher). The estimated five-year survival for patients with AS of the scalp in Okinawa was 9.2%. Multivariate analysis identified surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy as significant factors associated with patient survival. This study provides the first evidence of a significantly higher incidence rate of AS of the scalp in Okinawa. Given its rarity, further research is crucial to uncover the epidemiological, genetic, and environmental factors driving this cancer.",

        "abstract": "Cardiac angiosarcoma (CAS) is a rare, aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options. Both sporadic and familial cases occur, with recent links to germline POT1 mutations. The genomic landscape of this disease is poorly understood. We conducted comprehensive genomic profiling of CAS to assess the burden of germline predisposition and identify other recurrent genomic alterations of clinical significance. Six patients were female and four were male. The median age at presentation was 40 years (range 21- 69 years). All cases with available follow up exhibited an aggressive clinical course (6/8 patients died of disease). KDR alterations, including novel structural variants, were found in 9/11 cases, at a rate significantly higher than in non-cardiac angiosarcomas. POT1 mutations were present in 45.5% of CAS cases. In three of five POT1-mutant cases, the germline status was confirmed through testing of normal tissue and in one additional case, the germline status was inferred with high probability through allele frequency analysis. Additionally, we identified novel recurrent MED12 exon 2 mutations in POT1-wild type CAS, suggesting an alternative path to CAS oncogenesis. CAS demonstrate unique genetic profile, distinct from non-cardiac angiosarcoma. This study highlights the role of germline POT1 burden on CAS development and demonstrates recurrent MED12 alterations for the first time. The reported KDR variants provide a potential avenue for treatment of this aggressive disease. Given the prevalence of germline POT1 mutations reported herein, germline genetic testing should be considered in patients diagnosed with CAS.",

        "abstract": "As multiple imaging modalities cannot reliably diagnose cardiac tumors, the molecular approach offers alternative ways to detect rare ones. One such molecular approach is CRISPR-based diagnostics (CRISPR-Dx). CRISPR-Dx enables visual readout, portable diagnostics, and rapid and multiplex detection of nucleic acids such as microRNA (miRNA). Dysregulation of miRNA expressions has been associated with cardiac tumors such as atrial myxoma and angiosarcoma. Diverse CRISPR-Dx systems have been developed to detect miRNA in recent years. These CRISPR-Dx systems are generally classified into four classes, depending on the Cas proteins used (Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, or Cas12f). CRISPR/Cas systems are integrated with various isothermal amplifications to detect low-abundance miRNAs. Amplification-free CRISPR-Dx systems have also been recently developed to detect miRNA directly. Herein, we critically discuss the advances, pitfalls, and future perspectives for these CRISPR-Dx systems in detecting miRNA, focusing on the diagnosis and prognosis of cardiac tumors.",

        "abstract": "There has been noteworthy progress in molecular characterisation and therapeutics in soft tissue sarcomas. Novel agents have gained regulatory approval by the FDA. Examples are the tyrosine kinase inhibitors avapritinib and ripretinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST), the immune check point inhibitor atezolizumab in alveolar soft part tissue sarcoma, the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor nirogacestat in desmoid tumours, the NTRK inhibitors larotrectinib and entrectinib in tumours with <i>NTRK</i> fusions, the mTOR inhibitor nab-sirolimus in PEComa, and the EZH-2 inhibitor tazemetostat in epithelioid sarcoma. The FDA has also recently granted accelerated approval for autologous T-cell therapy with afami-cel in patients with HLA-A*02 and MAGE-A4-expressing synovial sarcoma. There are other promising treatments that are still investigational, such as MDM2 and CDK4/6 inhibitors in well-/dedifferentiated liposarcoma, immune checkpoint inhibitors in the head and neck angiosarcoma and a subset of patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, and PARP inhibitors in leiomyosarcoma. The challenges in drug development in soft tissue sarcoma are due to the rarity and the molecular heterogeneity of the disease and the fact that many subtypes are associated with complex karyotypes or non-targetable molecular alterations. We believe that progress maybe possible with a better understanding of the complex biology, the development of novel compounds for difficult targets such as proteolysis targeting chimeras (Protacs), the utilisation of modern clinical trial designs, and enhanced collaboration of academia with industry to develop treatments with a strong biologic rationale.",

The disease progresses rapidly, is challenging to manage, and has a high mortality rate. This case report presents a patient with AIDS-KS who experienced relapse after chemotherapy with anthracyclines. Subsequent chemotherapy with the same method had no significant effect. However, complete remission was achieved after the addition of a programmed cell death protein 1(PD-1) inhibitor, as confirmed by pathological biopsy. The PD-1 inhibitor was well-tolerated and had few adverse effects. It also helped to improve the immune reconstitution of the patient.

From 2015 to 2022, a total of 23 patients with HSC (n\u2009=\u200911) and HS (n\u2009=\u200912) are included in this retrospective study. We analyze the clinical, pathological, and imaging data of these patients. Analysis of differences is performed to determine the consistent and distinctive features. HSCs have a considerably higher prevalence of chronic hepatitis (p\u2009=\u20090.005) and cirrhosis (p\u2009=\u20090.027) than HSs, while metastases are more prevalent in HSs (p\u2009=\u20090.005). The lesion size of HSCs (8.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2\u00a0cm) is slightly larger than that of HSs (6.2\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4\u00a0cm). On conventional US, the characteristics of HS and HSC are similar. In CEUS, HSCs consistently showed heterogeneous enhancement patterns, while HSs, particularly hepatic angiosarcoma (HA), demonstrated a higher prevalence of hyperintensity (75%). On CECT, all masses in both groups exhibited low density. A statistically significant difference in margin clarity was observed between HSC and HS (p\u2009=\u20090.015). HSC and HS generally present as masses with hypo-echoic and hypo-vascularity. HSC usually presents heterogeneous density. The degree of enhancement, the time of wash-out start, and the presence of necrotic areas may contribute to distinguish the different pathological types of HS.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study is to explore the clinicopathological features, radiographic manifestations, treatment options, and prognosis of primary pulmonary angiosarcoma (PPAS). We summarized and analyzed the clinical data of 11 patients with primary pulmonary angiosarcoma treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University between January 2018 and January 2024. A retrospective analysis was conducted in conjunction with a review of the relevant literature. Among the 11 cases, the primary symptoms were nonspecific respiratory issues, with chest pain, cough, and shortness of breath being the most common. Initial diagnosis was correct in only 2 cases, while the remaining 9 cases were misdiagnosed as other conditions, such as lung nodules, infections, or pulmonary embolism. All patients were ultimately diagnosed via pathology, with CD31 and CD34 showing a high positivity rate of 60%. Of the 11 patients, 9 have died, and 2 remain alive. The average survival period was 13.2 months.Based on the number of lesions, PPAS was categorized into three types: solitary, multiple, and invasive pulmonary artery. The average survival period for the solitary type (2 cases) was 15.5 months, for the multiple type (5 cases) was 6.6 months, and for the pulmonary artery type (4 cases) was 20.5 months. Among the 3 patients who underwent surgery, the median overall survival (OS) was 23.0 months, whereas for the 8 non-surgical patients, the median OS was 9.7 months. Primary pulmonary angiosarcoma is a rare, highly aggressive vascular malignancy characterized by nonspecific clinical symptoms and a tendency for metastasis and pulmonary artery embolism. Currently, no effective treatment exists, and the overall prognosis is poor.",

        "abstract": "Sarcomas are a rare type of malignancy with limited treatment options so far. This analysis aimed to describe the impact of lymphadenectomy on treating sarcoma patients. Sarcomas characterized by lymphatic spread are rare. For this reason, lymphadenectomy is not a procedure that is performed frequently. However, there are histological subtypes that spread more frequently through lymphatic vessels, such as rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), epithelioid sarcoma (ES), clear cell sarcoma (CCS), and angiosarcoma. On the other hand, synovial sarcoma (SS) is not characterized by an increased tendency to lymphogenous metastases. In our study, we focus on these subtypes of sarcomas. The relationship between lymphadenectomy results and the subsequent prognosis of the patients was investigated. Metastases in the lymph nodes are diagnosed synchronously with distant metastases or when the primary tumor is detected. At the same time, despite lymphadenectomy, sarcoma patients developed further distant metastases. Currently, lymphadenectomy is not a routinely recommended method of treatment for patients with sarcomas. Most often, its potential use is indicated in the case of epithelioid sarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma after a previous positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) result. Multicenter randomized prospective clinical trials on the role of lymphadenectomy in the treatment of sarcomas are needed.",

We present the case of a 51-year-old woman with neurological symptoms of paraparesis and constipation who underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that revealed a well-demarcated, predominantly homogeneous, intensely enhancing intradural extramedullary lesion in T2-weighted images. Histology, immunohistochemistry, and genetics of the lesion showed an angiosarcoma. The patient received adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) and is currently stable, showing no signs of recurrence, in the third year of follow-up. Our work demonstrates a rare case of extramedullary intradural primary spinal angiosarcoma, highlighting the challenges associated with its diagnosis. The multidisciplinary approach, including surgery and adjuvant RT, has been shown to effectively control the disease. Although the prognosis is generally poor, the presented case shows apparent success.",

        "title": "New Germline TP53 Variant Detected After Radiotherapy-Induced Angiosarcoma of the Chest Wall in a Previously Treated Breast Cancer Patient: A Case Report and Review of Li-Fraumeni Syndrome and Radiotherapy-Induced Sarcoma.",
        "abstract": "Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is one of the most common hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes in Brazil. The high frequency of the syndrome is due to a founding variant (R337H) in the country. LFS is characterized by a wide variety of malignant phenotypes. Despite the great epidemiological importance of the R337H variant, the frequency of other types of pathogenic variants is like other populations, with the majority of these being missense variants. There is strong evidence that radiotherapy is associated with secondary sarcomas, including angiosarcomas, and this finding is especially true for LFS patients. Angiosarcoma is not described as overrepresented in individuals with LFS, except in patients submitted to radiotherapy. Germline testing in all breast cancer patients under 65 will reveal many germline mutations in TP53 without a family history of cancers associated with the syndrome. We present a case of a previously undescribed pathogenic variant in TP53 (c788del, pAns263llefs\u2063<sup>\u2217</sup>82) in a patient with no family history of cancer, with a previous diagnosis of breast carcinoma treated with radiotherapy, who developed angiosarcoma after a few years leading to germline testing. The presence of angiosarcoma in a radiotherapy bed should raise suspicion for LFS. The recent recommendation of testing breast cancer patients under the age of 65, even without any family history, can be a source of discoveries of new mutations and assist in therapeutic decisions.",

A retrospective study involved patients with sarcomas of the head and neck region who were diagnosed and treated over a 5-year period. Nine patients were included, 4 men and 5 women. The mean age of the patients was 51 years. Eight patients had soft tissue sarcomas, and 1 patient had osteosarcoma. The most common histologic types were dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and angiosarcoma. Tumors presented predominantly with local symptomatology. All patients were treated only by surgical excision. No distant or regional metastases were found in any patient. Complete surgical excision was achieved in all cases, except in patients with chondrosarcoma of the nose and sinuses, who died due to local progression in the second year of follow-up. Other patients were disease-free during the observed period; a patient with osteosarcoma died in the fourth year of follow-up without recurrence of the malignant disease. Large prospective and multicenter studies are necessary to provide relevant data on the distribution of different types of sarcoma in the head and neck region, their clinical behavior and response to therapeutic modalities, as well as on recurrence, presence of metastases, and survival.",

        "abstract": "Angiosarcoma is a rapidly proliferating vascular tumor that originates in endothelial cells of vessels. Rarely, it can be associated with consumptive coagulopathy due to disseminated intravascular coagulation eventually leading to thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. This specific manifestation is termed Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. Patients usually present with manifestations related to the primary diagnosis of angiosarcoma depending on the organ it is involving. However, if Kasabach-Merritt syndrome has occurred, it will present with manifestations such as bleeding and thromboembolic phenomenon. To date, no favorable outcomes have been documented, and the overall prognosis remains grim. A 44-year-old male patient of Afghan origin developed typical signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis, that is, fever, cough, hemoptysis, weight loss, and night sweats. He was initially managed in an Afghan medical facility where workup for tuberculosis was done but came back negative. He empirically received anti-tuberculous therapy owing to typical presentation and tuberculosis being endemic in the area. The condition of the patient worsened, and he presented to our facility (Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, Pakistan). Workup led to the diagnosis of a metastatic vascular neoplasm, which was further complicated with consumptive coagulopathy, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. This presentation is known as Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. Multidisciplinary team discussion was called, and it was decided to proceed with palliative chemotherapy with paclitaxel. Although a patient may present with typical signs and symptoms of, but negative workup for, TB, if there is a high index of suspicion and the patient is receiving empirical treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis, clinical worsening should alert to think about differential diagnosis. In our case, histopathological analysis of lymph node and radiological findings led us to the diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Vesicle Amine Transport-1 (VAT1) is a protein that is overexpressed in many cancers, including breast cancer, glioblastoma, and angiosarcoma. High VAT1 expression correlates with poor overall survival, and genetic knockout models of VAT1 indicate potent antimigratory activity, suggesting that VAT1 is a promising antimetastasis target. Recently, the natural product neocarzilin A (NCA) from <i>Streptomyces carzinostaticus</i> was reported to be the first validated small-molecule inhibitor of VAT1, having strong activity in metastasis models of angiosarcoma and breast cancer. While knockdown of VAT1 has no effect on cell viability, NCA has significant cytotoxicity, suggesting that NCA is not selective for VAT1. Additionally, NCA has poor aqueous solubility, making <i>in vivo</i> administration of NCA challenging and thus limiting its therapeutic potential. Here, we report the design, synthesis, bioactivity, and pharmacokinetics of novel NCA derivatives with improved drug-like properties. Specifically, we have developed derivatives with altered warheads, replacing chlorines on the trichloroketone with fluorines. Using a modified synthetic route, we accessed NCA derivatives with greater than 25-fold improvements in solubility and 30-fold improvements in the antimigratory to antiproliferative bioactivity ratio. The two best derivatives, along with the parent, were analyzed for oral bioavailability, with the two more soluble derivatives showing greatly improved bioavailability. Overall, these studies have resulted in the development of VAT1 inhibitors with improved properties, which will enable further study of the pharmacological inhibition of VAT1 as an antimetastatic strategy. Additionally, these studies provide insights into novel trihalomethyl ketone warheads and identify chlorodifluoroketone as a potent and selective new warhead.",

        "abstract": "Angiosarcomas are a group of vascular cancers that form malignant blood vessels. These malignancies are seemingly inflamed primarily due to their pathognomonic nature, which consists of irregular endothelium and tortuous blood channels. PIK3CA mutations are oncogenic and disrupt the PI3K pathway. In this study, we aimed to define the molecular and functional consequences of oncogenic PIK3CA mutations in angiosarcoma. We first generated two isogenic hemangiosarcoma cell lines harboring the H1047R hotspot mutations in PIK3CA gene using CRISPR/Cas9. We found PIK3CA-mutant cells established distinct molecular signatures in global gene expression and chromatin accessibility, which were associated with enrichment of immune cytokine signaling, including IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1. These molecular processes were disrupted by the PI3K-\u03b1 specific inhibitor, alpelisib. We also observed that the molecular distinctions in PIK3CA-mutant cells were linked to metabolic reprogramming in glycolytic activity and mitochondrial respiration. Our multi-omics analysis revealed that activating PIK3CA mutations regulate molecular machinery that contributes to phenotypic alterations and resistance to alpelisib. Furthermore, we identified potential therapeutic vulnerabilities of PIK3CA mutations in response to PI3K-\u03b1 inhibition mediated by MAPK signaling. In summary, we demonstrate that PIK3CA mutations perpetuate PI3K activation and reinforce immune enrichment to promote drug resistance in vascular cancers.",

        "abstract": "Paragangliomas originating from blood vessels are exceptionally rare, presenting diagnostic challenges due to their histological resemblance to other vascular neoplasms. We present a case study of a 60-year-old woman with underlying hypertension and dyslipidemia with obesity, initially diagnosed with angiosarcoma based on imaging and histological characteristics viewed via CT-guided biopsy. Intraoperative exploration revealed a lobulated tumor located between the inferior vena cava (IVC) and aorta measuring 7 cm \u00d7 8 cm, during which the patient developed transient hemodynamic instabilities. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining using neuroendocrine markers (chromogranin, synaptophysin, S-100 protein, and CD-56) later confirmed the tumor as a retroperitoneal paraganglioma. Retroperitoneal paraganglioma was initially misdiagnosed as angiosarcoma due to the overlapping imaging characteristics between the two tumors. This highlights the importance of raising suspicion on the possibility of retroperitoneal paraganglioma when imaging examination indicates angiosarcoma and to incorporate histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis to avoid misdiagnosis.",

This is a retrospective study with a cohort of 216 patients with advanced sarcoma treated with ICIs between 2016-2023 at Stanford Health Care. Overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), objective response rates per RECIST criteria (ORR), and reason for ICI discontinuation were analyzed across histologic subtypes, ICI regimens, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and PD-L1 expression. The overall ORR in the cohort was 16.7%. The histologic subtypes with the highest ORR were Kaposi sarcoma (KS, 66.7%), alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS, 50%), angiosarcoma (AS, 33.3%), myxofibrosarcoma (MFS, 28.6%), and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS, 27.8%). The subtypes with the lowest ORR were osteosarcoma (0%), synovial sarcoma (SS, 0%), and liposarcoma (LPS, 3.7%). The subtypes with the highest median PFS were KS (median not reached, NR), ASPS (NR), MFS (27.4 months), and UPS (11.3 months). The ORR for sarcomas with PD-L1 \u2265 1% was 27.8% (p=0.02), while the ORR for sarcomas with TMB \u2265 10 mutations per megabase of DNA (mut/MB) was 28.6% (p=0.20). ORR and PFS were highly variable across sarcoma histologic subtype. In this large analysis, KS, ASPS, AS, MFS, and UPS demonstrated the highest ORR and longest PFS while osteosarcoma, SS, and LPS had the lowest ORR and shortest PFS. PD-L1 expression was also associated with increased ORR. Our findings provide further insight into understanding the sarcoma histologic and immunologic factors that correspond with response to ICIs.",

BoNTs can be classified into seven serotypes (A to G) based on their antigenic properties. Among these, BoNT/A is one of the most common serotypes. This was a case of foodborne botulism in Weihai caused by homemade pickled eggs contaminated with <i>C. botulinum</i>. Five individuals presented with symptoms, while three were asymptomatic. All patients received botulinum antitoxin treatment, and no deaths occurred. During this outbreak, 12 isolates of <i>C. botulinum</i> were obtained. The phylogenetic analysis results revealed that all the isolates came from the same origin. This outbreak indicated that foodborne botulism remains a public health issue in China. We need to strengthen publicity and education efforts to inform people of the potential risk of botulism associated with consuming homemade traditional pickled foods. Heating and boiling homemade foods thoroughly can destroy toxins and prevent foodborne botulism.",

        "abstract": "Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) is the most potent and prevalent neurotoxin known to cause botulism, and is also widely used in medical and cosmetic applications. The detection of BoNT/A is of great significance for botulism diagnosis and drug potency determination. Currently, the mouse bioassay (MBA) has long been the gold standard method but has disadvantages of ethical concerns, long testing duration, and high costs. CFP/YFP-based FRET sensors for detecting BoNT/A biological activity require complicated experimental control due to crosstalk, as well as inconvenient operation, intricate data analysis and UV-induced phototoxicity. In present work, a FRET-based EGFP-SNAP25(141-206)-DsRED molecular sensor was developed to analyze the endopeptidase activity of BoNT/A, and methodological validation was performed. The results showed that the sensor has a high sensitivity of 4 U, with a linear range from 7.8 U to 125 U, a recovery rate of 96.8\u00a0% to 122.7\u00a0%, and a precision within 20\u00a0%. Furthermore, a cellular sensor for FRET-based BoNT/A biological activity detection was successfully constructed with a Neuro-2a cell line stably expressing the EGFP-SNAP25-tDimer2 variant, enabling the monitoring of the entire process of BoNT/A action. The cell-based assay exhibited a sensitivity of up to 100 pM of BoNT/A with a linear range from 3.125\u00a0nM to 50\u00a0nM and a recovery rate of 86.3\u00a0% to 117.2\u00a0%. The FRET-based molecular and cellular sensors provided a convenient and rapid method for measuring BoNT/A biological activity, making them suitable for assessing BoNT/A raw material biological activities in clinical and environmental samples, as well as batches during pharmaceutical production processes.",

In the late 19th century, the serum or plasma of animals or patients who had recovered from infectious diseases or who had been immunised with a relevant antigen began to be used to treat or prevent infections. Before the advent of widespread vaccination campaigns, antitoxins played a key role in the treatment and prevention of diseases such as diphtheria and tetanus. A significant reduction in mortality following the introduction of antitoxins confirmed their efficacy. Serum therapy remains an important measure for post-exposure prophylaxis and for the treatment of unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated patients. For the botulinum toxin, antitoxin therapy continues to be the sole available treatment. The manuscript contains a summary of the most important information on the passive immunoprophylaxis used in the treatment of diphtheria, tetanus, and botulism, all representing diseases in which symptoms are driven by the activity of highly potent bacterial toxins.",

        "abstract": "Botulinum neurotoxin, produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, causes botulism, a severe, rapidly progressing, and potentially fatal condition. Swift detection of the toxin and timely administration of antitoxin antibodies are critical for effective treatment. The current standard for Botulinum toxin testing is the mouse lethality assay, but this method is time-consuming and requires live animals. Consequently, a key focus of research is the development of antibodies for both diagnostic purposes and toxin neutralization. Botulinum neurotoxin serotype B (BoNT/B), one of the most dangerous and prevalent serotypes, is commonly involved in poisoning cases. Like other botulinum toxins, BoNT/B consists of heavy and light chains. In this study, we generated mouse monoclonal antibodies targeting the BoNT/B light chain (BoNT/B-LC) through hybridoma cell line development. Two monoclonal hybridomas (3B7 and 3C6) were selected from a pool of 18 polyclonal hybridomas and used to produce anti-BoNT/B-LC antibodies through the ascites fluid production. The antibodies were utilized for indirect ELISA detection of recombinant BoNT/B-LC. Notably, the assay with 3B7 demonstrated higher sensitivity, allowing for the detection of TrxA-fused BoNT/B-LC (68.9\u00a0kDa) at concentrations as low as 4\u00a0ng/mL. These results highlight the potential of the generated antibodies for rapid BoNT/B detection, offering a promising alternative to animal-based testing.",

        "abstract": "The article is devoted to a form of botulism that has been little studied in our country and is registered exclusively in infants. The fundamental difference between this form and the most common foodborne botulism is that infants become infected by ingestion of spores, followed by their germination, colonization of the intestines and production of botulinum toxin <i>in situ</i>, which leads to the development of life-threatening flaccid paralysis. Taking into account the peculiarities of pathogenesis, the clinical manifestations of infant botulism have some features, which are discussed by the authors. Particular attention is paid to the epidemiology and risk factors for the development of the disease. The article discusses in detail the issues of diagnosis and laboratory verification of the etiology of the disease. Current data on the treatment of infant botulism are presented.",

        "abstract": "Accurately assessing potential side effects following botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) injection remains a formidable challenge. To address this issue, an innovative approach is developed that combines a wearable temperature sensor with a sophisticated volatilomics technique, aimed at facilitating the rapid and convenient prediction of potential physical discomfort related to latrogenic botulism. The investigation identifies five volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-acetone, styrene, ethanol, 2-pentanone, and n-butano-as promising markers indicative of BoNT poisoning. Specifically, a handheld breath analyzer, featuring a yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ)-based gas sensor array, alongside a wearable temperature sensor integrated with a bio-compatible methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) sensing film, are developed to simultaneously monitor breath signal variations and body temperature fluctuations. Preliminary animal testing validates the effectiveness of the integrated approach, achieving an accuracy exceeding 91.2% in early detection of physical discomfort associated with BoNT poisoning. These promising findings represent a significant advancement towards the early identification of BoNT-related issues, enabling timely intervention and improved management strategies.",

        "abstract": "Open ventral hernia repair is one of the most commonly performed surgeries by general surgeons worldwide. In the case of complex incisional hernias, there are adjunct techniques that can help abdominal wall reconstruction surgery, such as type A botulinum toxin (BTA), whose injection results in muscle relaxation and growth of muscle fiber length, allowing fascial closure without the need for advanced techniques. We report a case of a male patient who underwent ultrasound-guided BTA injection in the abdominal wall and, five days later, was admitted to our emergency department with dysarthria, muscular weakness, dyspnea on small exertion, and constipation. There was a rapid worsening of respiratory failure, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. After the exclusion of other neurological conditions, iatrogenic botulism was assumed to be the most likely cause. There are adjunct tools that allow successful abdominal wall reconstruction, such as BTA, which is relatively safe. On rare occasions, systemic absorption of BTA can lead to systemic effects, such as iatrogenic botulism, that can be extremely severe. We have not found any case reports about iatrogenic botulism related to BTA use in abdominal wall musculature. This is the first documented case of iatrogenic botulism related to BTA injection in the abdominal wall musculature. Given its severity, it is important that surgeons working with BTA are aware of these potential complications.",

        "abstract": "Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT), the agent causing botulism, exhibit the highest potency among bacterial toxins and pose a significant threat to both humans and animals. The current in vivo method (mouse lethality assay, MLA) is inappropriate for real-time and pen-side assessment of the occurring outbreak or case. Herein, we describe a reflective-based biosensor capable of detecting the toxin's type and activity state by competitive immunoassay and endopeptidase activity, respectively. Two serotypes (BoNT-B and BoNT-C) were assessed independently by SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si interferometers using simulating antigens or specific peptides (i.e., synaptosomal-associated protein and vesicle-associated membrane protein). The reflective responses of both platforms were biochemically amplified using 4-chloro-1-naphthol oxidation into insoluble products. The resulting refractive index variations were observed in real-time using re\ufb02ective interferometric Fourier transform spectroscopy. The portable bioassay depicted high sensitivity, selectivity, and near real-time rapid assessment (0.14 and 0.47\u00a0pg\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> for BoNT-C and BoNT-B, negligible interferences with interfering serotypes, respectively). Additionally, the applicability of the bioassay for monitoring extracted toxins was tested against the in vivo method with satisfactory performance values. Overall, the presented approach can improve field assessment of new botulism incidences by acquiring epidemiological data in near real-time, thus eliminating the need for the MLA approach.",

In the framework of the EU project EuroBioTox, we organized an international proficiency test for the detection and quantification of the clinically relevant BoNT/A, B, E, and F sero- and subtypes including concentrations as low as 0.5 ng/mL. BoNTs were spiked in serum, milk, and soil matrices. Here, we evaluate the results of 18 laboratories participating in this PT. Participants have implemented a wide array of detection methods based on functional, immunological, and mass spectrometric principles. Methods implemented in this proficiency test notably included endopeptidase assays either coupled to mass spectrometry (Endopep-MS) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Endopep-ELISA). This interlaboratory exercise pinpoints the most effective and complementary methods shared by the greatest number of participants, also highlighting the importance of combining the training of selected methods and of distributing toxin reference material to reduce the variability of quantitative data.",

        "abstract": "Anal fissures, tears in the epithelium of the anal canal that cause pain and bleeding, have a lifetime prevalence of 11%. While surgical treatments, such as lateral internal sphincterotomy are traditional, they pose postoperative complications. Recent studies investigated less invasive options involving botulinum toxin injection, showing promise with fewer adverse effects. The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes of botulinum toxin injection to lateral internal sphincterotomy for chronic anal fissures. Up to October 2023, an extensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar to identify relevant papers. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the comparative effectiveness of lateral internal sphincterotomy and botulinum toxin injection in the treatment of chronic anal fissures. The methodology adheres to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) criteria, and the study protocol has been registered with the Open Science Framework (OSF). A total of 1,839 patients from 18 trials were included in the meta-analysis. Patients undergoing lateral internal sphincterotomy had higher healing compared to botulinum toxin injection (pooled effect\u2009=\u20090.77; 95% CI= [0.69- 0.83]; I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200990.95%; P\u2009=\u20090.00). Our study revealed the efficacy of lateral internal sphincterotomy over botulinum toxin injection in promoting healing for chronic anal fissures. These findings emphasize the clinical advantage of traditional surgical interventions in the management of this condition. However, further studies with long-term follow-up are required to confirm our observations.",

        "abstract": "Clostridial infections, known for their severity and rapid progression, present significant challenges in both clinical and veterinary fields. These bacteria, which can survive without oxygen and produce protective spores, cause many diseases, ranging from simple gastrointestinal disorders to severe and potentially fatal infections including botulism, tetanus, and gas gangrene. The rising occurrence of antibiotic-resistant strains and the repetitive character of some Clostridial illnesses, including Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI), highlight the immediate need for alternate treatment approaches. Postbiotics, which are metabolites derived from probiotics, are showing great potential as effective agents against these diseases. The current study offers a comprehensive investigation of the potential of postbiotics as therapeutic agents for treating Clostridial infections, including C. difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, and Clostridium tetani. It also examines the processes by which postbiotics exert their effects. Preliminary investigations have shown that postbiotics have promising antibacterial and antibiofilm properties, indicating their potential as adjunct agents in methods for controlling microbial growth. Nevertheless, more study is required to thoroughly demonstrate their medicinal uses.",

        "abstract": "The recent unprecedented foodborne botulism outbreak in Saudi Arabia necessitated an assessment of healthcare workers' (HCWs) knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP). This study assessed healthcare workers' knowledge regarding the transmission, contagiousness, presentation, and diagnosis of foodborne botulism, as well as their management practices, including contacting public health authorities, administering antitoxin, preparedness to respond to botulism cases and consulting generative Artificial Intelligent (AI)-chatbots, like ChatGPT. A cross-sectional online survey targeting Saudi HCWs was conducted from May 6-19, 2024, following the first foodborne botulism outbreak. The survey, developed by infectious disease and public health experts according to the Saudi Public Health Authority (SPHA) botulism guidelines, covered several sections: demographics, knowledge about foodborne botulism, attitudes and perceptions, intended practices, and worry level. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, multivariable linear regression to assess factors influencing knowledge, and multivariable logistic binary regression to evaluate factors affecting confidence in handling botulism. Among the 1058 participants, the knowledge score was 9.69/20 (48.4\u00a0% correct \u00b1\u00a018\u00a0%), with higher scores among HCWs working in tertiary centers, older than 34 years, reading SPHA botulism protocol, and using scientific journals as main information sources. HCWs consulting ChatGPT had significantly lower knowledge scores (p-value < 0.001). HCWs displayed highly intended practices in managing botulism, with a mean score of 4.10/5. The self-rated management confidence was moderate (2.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.05 out of 5-points). Multivariable logistic binary regression showed that previous experience with botulism and reading SPHA protocol were the most significant factors associated with a higher management confidence. This study highlights significant HCWs' knowledge gaps during unprecedented foodborne botulism outbreak. Previous experience with botulism cases and reading recent guidelines were associated with higher knowledge and confidence, while reliance on ChatGPT was linked to lower scores. This study emphasizes the importance of timely publishing local guidelines to favorably affect both knowledge and confidence to deal with infectious outbreaks. Future research should evaluate long-term effectiveness of educational interventions.",

        "abstract": "Botulism is a rare and life-threatening disease caused by the potent botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), which can be produced by Clostridium botulinum (C. botulinum) and related bacteria. Clinical manifestations, which include a symmetrical, descending muscular paralysis, generalized hypotonia, and potentially respiratory failure, are non-specific and diagnosis is challenging, especially when anamnesis does not reveal any typical risk factor, like honey consumption. We present what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first documented case of infant botulism (IB) in Sicily and discuss its peculiarities and the challenges faced in the diagnostic-therapeutic process. The infant was exclusively breastfed and no history of consumption of possibly contaminated foods, like honey, was found. The signs observed at presentation included poor suction, hypotonia, and hyporeactivity. A detailed anamnesis motivated the suspicion of botulism, due to the occurrence of constipation and exposure to dust from home renovation works during the days before the onset of symptoms. The botulinum antitoxin was administered and the diagnosis was confirmed through fecal examination, detecting toxin-producing C. botulinum. IB should be considered in every infant with rapidly progressing hypotonia and a history of constipation. However rarely, transmission could occur through inhalation of dust particles containing the toxin, therefore it is important to explore all possible sources of exposure. In the case described, timely diagnosis and treatment determined the successful outcome, which highlights the importance of early intervention in managing IB.",

        "abstract": "We sought to identify counties in the northeastern United States where the incidence of infant botulism (IB) is elevated compared to the nationwide incidence and to assess associations with soil type at the case residence. IB cases were identified through the distribution of the orphan drug Human Botulism Immune Globulin Intravenous for treatment of IB by state and national surveillance systems and were subsequently confirmed by laboratory testing. IB incidence by county was calculated as the number of IB cases divided by the number of live births in the county from 2000 to 2019. Cases were spatially mapped and assigned to soil types using the US Department of Agriculture's online soils database. Possible association with soil type was evaluated with the Chi-squared test. We identified a rectangular area consisting of 17 contiguous counties in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, approximately 80 km by 250 km, in which the 20-year incidence of IB was nearly seven times greater than that of the remaining counties in those five states. Within this area, case residences were strongly associated with certain soil types (<i>P</i> \u2264 0.003). From 2000 to 2019, IB occurred with disproportionate incidence in a rectangular area encompassing the lower Delaware and Raritan River Valley and parts of five adjacent states. Further investigation of the soils in counties from this area could assess whether <i>C. botulinum</i> is more prevalent in certain soil types and whether isolation of <i>C. botulinum</i> is more common in counties with higher IB incidence. Infant botulism occurs more frequently in 17 counties within and adjacent to the Delaware and Raritan River watersheds. This study should alert physicians and pediatricians in the area to the higher likelihood of encountering cases of this otherwise rare disease that manifests with constipation, poor feeding, loss of head control, weak suck/cry, generalized weakness, and descending bilateral paralysis.",

        "abstract": "Intragastric botulinum neurotoxin injections (IBNI) are offered off-label in the private medical sector in a few European countries as a safe and effective weight-loss measure. In February and March 2023, an outbreak of iatrogenic botulism occurred in several European countries following IBNI treatment in Turkey. This case series describes the clinical features of severe iatrogenic botulism after IBNI. We retrospectively summarize the clinical course and emergency department and intensive care unit interventions in ten cases of severe iatrogenic botulism that occurred after receiving IBNI in this sudden outbreak in Austria and Germany. Seven out of ten cases initially showed characteristic symptoms of botulism with diplopia, dysphagia, dysarthria, dysarthrophonia, and descending paralysis. All patients were hospitalized, six in an intensive care unit and partially requiring mechanical ventilation. All patients recovered and were discharged without relevant permanent deficits. Our study highlights ten clinical cases in this iatrogenic botulism outbreak, representing the largest reported outbreak worldwide. Clinicians should be aware of the risks associated with medical procedures involving botulinum neurotoxins and ensure measures to minimize the risk of iatrogenic botulism.",

        "abstract": "Clostridial infections in cattle are a significant concern for Brazilian livestock. These diseases are caused by various species of <i>Clostridium</i>, which are known for their ability to produce potent toxins. Botulism in cattle is a serious and often fatal condition caused by the ingestion of neurotoxins produced by <i>C. botulinum</i>. This bacterium thrives in decomposing organic matter, such as spoiled feed, carcasses, and contaminated water. Tetanus is less common, but it is a serious disease that follows the contamination of wounds with <i>Clostridium tetani</i> spores. It results in muscle stiffness, spasms, and often death due to respiratory failure. Blackleg (<i>C. chauvoei</i>) is a disease that primarily affects young cattle, leading to acute lameness, swelling, and high fever. Malignant edema (<i>C. septicum</i> and others) is characterized by rapid onset of swelling at wound sites, and it can occur after injuries or surgical procedures. Enterotoxemia is triggered by the rapid growth of <i>C. perfringens</i> in the gut following excessive carbohydrate intake. This leads to toxin production that causes sudden death. In conclusion, clostridial bovine infections remain a persistent challenge for Brazilian cattle farmers. With continued focus on vaccination, good management practices, and research, the impact of these diseases can be minimized, safeguarding the livestock industry's economic viability.",

        "abstract": "Neurotoxins produced by Clostridium (C.) botulinum group III are responsible for the majority of botulism outbreaks occurring in animals and in this study we report the drug susceptibility of 71 field strains. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 13 antimicrobials was established through the agar dilution method. The MIC<sub>50</sub> matched or differed for one or two dilutions from MIC<sub>90</sub> of the same antimicrobial, showing a unimodal distribution of the MIC values, irrespective of the geographical origin, the animal source and the toxinotype of the strain. Beta-lactams and rifampin showed the lowest MIC values, while gentamicin, polymyxin B and sulfamethoxazole showed the highest MICs. As for similar studies conducted in human botulism, the results could be helpful to avoid the administration of antimicrobials that could worsen the health condition of the affected animals and to develop selective media for the isolation of these fastidious anaerobes. Indeed, the isolation of the strain from affected animals and from environmental samples is important to perform epidemiological studies based on the genetic characterization and to produce tailor-made vaccines.",

        "abstract": "Infantile botulism is a potentially life-threatening neuromuscular disorder. It presents with descending paralysis that can involve the diaphragm and cause respiratory failure. Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) provides synchronized bilevel positive pressure by using electrical diaphragmatic (Edi) signals. Diaphragmatic paresis is thought to be a contraindication for using NAVA. However, the use of a NAVA catheter allows continuous assessment of diaphragm activity in infantile botulism. We discuss a case of infantile botulism in an infant from central Pennsylvania who presented with poor oral feeding, hypothermia, and lethargy and progressed to develop apnea and acute respiratory failure. The infant was intubated and mechanically ventilated. A diagnosis of infantile botulism was confirmed through the detection of botulinum toxin in the infant's stool, and the infant was treated with botulism immune globulin neutralizing antibodies. During his recovery phase, a NAVA catheter was placed, which allowed monitoring of Edi signals to gauge the return of diaphragm activity and to assist with the assessment of extubation readiness. We describe the trends in this infant's Edi signals following administration of globulin neutralizing antibodies and the successful transition to invasive, and subsequently, noninvasive NAVA. Our report demonstrates the clinical utility of monitoring diaphragmatic activity using a NAVA catheter and that NAVA provided adequate respiratory support to an infant during the recovery phase of infantile botulism.",

        "abstract": "To characterize cases of outpatients with infant botulism (IB) in the US identified by the Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program at the California Department of Public Health from 1976 through\u00a02021. Outpatient IB cases were defined as patients presenting with an illness consistent with the known paralyzing action of botulinum neurotoxin and with laboratory confirmation. Outpatient cases were distinguished from the majority of patients with IB by the atypical fact that they did not require hospitalization throughout the course of their illness. Of the 4372 cases of IB identified by the Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program over a 45-year period (1976-2021), 17 (0.4%) were outpatient cases. Most (11/17; 65%) cases occurred in California. The median age at disease onset was 20\u00a0weeks (range\u00a0=\u00a06 to 55\u00a0weeks). The most common symptom among cases was constipation (16/17; 94%). Most patients (16/17; 94%) had at least one cranial nerve palsy, manifested as decreased head control, ptosis, weak cry, or poor suck. Outpatient IB occurs nationwide, although clinical diagnosis may be difficult because the severity of symptoms do not necessitate hospitalization or more comprehensive clinical intervention. Identification of outpatient cases requires an astute clinician and a capable, willing diagnostic testing laboratory. It is likely that more outpatient cases of IB are occurring than are presently recognized in infants mildly affected by this disease. Healthcare providers should consider the possibility of IB when presented with a previously well infant with failure to thrive, poor feeding, constipation, mild hypotonia, or cranial nerve palsy.",

        "abstract": "Many inherited metabolic disorders (IMD) are associated with end-organ damage necessitating organ transplantation. Although utilization of deceased donors with history of IMD warrants caution, there may be circumstances under which such donors could be considered as suitable organ donor candidates. We present the first known report of liver transplantation from a deceased donor with cystinosis. The donor was a 20-year-old male with infantile cystinosis who had previously undergone two deceased donor kidney transplants. Unfortunately, he incurred cranial trauma, and after careful consideration of the metabolic consequences, his liver was deemed suitable for transplantation. The liver was successfully transplanted into a 65-year-old female recipient with hepatitis C (HCV) cirrhosis. The recipient is currently 12\u2009months post-transplant and experiencing good graft function without evidence of cystine crystals on liver biopsy. This case highlights that liver transplantation from donors with rare IMD can result in favorable outcomes. However, it is crucial to approach the use of such livers with caution. These transplants should be considered after a thorough assessment, ensuring that a comprehensive decision-making process is in place to mitigate potential risks.",

        "abstract": "Few studies have assessed patient-reported experience measures in nephropathic cystinosis. This study uses patient reports focused on the impact of cystinosis, cysteamine treatment-associated problems, and therapeutic adherence and suggests potential actions for improvement. In March 2022, six patients with nephropathic cystinosis treated with cysteamine, aged between 12 and 40 years as well as two caregivers, underwent standardized online interviews. Further, in April 2022, two online workshops were organized, each one with the participation of an advisory board consisting of up to four patients and six caregivers. As a result, the first patient journey mapping was developed considering pre-diagnosis, diagnosis and post-diagnosis steps, prescription of treatment, laboratory tests and daily life for patients, categorized by age (children, teenagers, adults). A patient support programme was also considered. Patients were not completely aware of the risks associated with non-adherence. The main factors explaining poor adherence were impaired sleep and chronic fatigue, both related to cysteamine night dosing and prominent gastrointestinal symptoms. These factors have a negative impact on the daily lives of patients. Opportunities for improvement in disease management and therapeutic adherence in nephropathic cystinosis were highlighted. Consequently, a series of lines of action and suggestions were made. This qualitative study offers insights on nephropathic cystinosis from the point of view of patients and parents/caregivers. The critical steps during patient journey and the pitfalls for therapeutic adherence have been highlighted, opening ways to improve not only disease management but also the quality of life of patients with cystinosis.A lay summary is provided as supplementary material; available at: https://www.drugsincontext.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/dic.2024-7-1-Suppl-Lay-Summary.pdf.",

        "abstract": "To evaluate ocular treatment adherence and its impact on clinical outcomes in patients with cystinosis in southwestern Ontario, where the disease incidence is higher due to a founder effect in the Old Order Amish population. This was a retrospective case series of patients with ocular cystinosis seen at Victoria Hospital and the Ivey Eye Institute at St Joseph's Health Care in London, Ontario, Canada, from 2008 to 2023. The authors investigated the demographics, ocular manifestations, and visual outcomes and characteristics in pediatric patients with ocular cystinosis. They also conducted qualitative analysis to characterize medication compliance and identify treatment barriers to compliance. This study included 14 patients with ocular cystinosis. In southwestern Ontario, the incidence of cystinosis is approximately 1 in 4,700 live births. Most patients were Old Order Amish, with a family history of cystinosis and consanguineous parents. During treatment, patients were typically asymptomatic, but photophobia was the most reported symptom. Slit-lamp examination revealed cystine crystals in the cornea of all patients; however, best corrected visual acuity and intraocular pressure were unremarkable in every case. A Fisher's exact test revealed a trend toward lower compliance in Amish patients compared to non-Amish patients (odds ratio: 0.067, <i>P</i> = .103). Significant treatment barriers for patients with ocular cystinosis were identified, including compliance issues with frequent eye drop regimens, educational and financial burdens, and geographical and cultural challenges, all impacting patient care and follow-up. This study highlights the need for improved strategies to improve treatment compliance and overcome barriers to care for patients with ocular cystinosis, particularly within the Old Order Amish population in southwestern Ontario, to ensure better clinical outcomes and quality of life. <b>[<i>J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus</i>. 20XX;XX(X):XXX-XXX.]</b>.",

        "abstract": "Corneal cystine accumulation results in photophobia and affects patients' quality of life. We assessed the efficacy and safety of cysteamine 0.55% solution in Japanese cystinosis patients with corneal cystine crystals for 52\u00a0weeks. This was a Phase III, open-label, single-arm study conducted in Japan (jRCT2021200029; registered on 07/12/2020). Patients with white blood cell cystine levels >1 nmol/half-cystine/mg protein or presence of corneal cystine crystal deposits identified by slit-lamp biomicroscopy were included. The primary endpoint was assessed as the in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) total score of 7 corneal layers. Visual acuity, photophobia and safety (adverse events [AEs]) endpoints were also evaluated. Six patients (four males and two females) were included. The mean age (standard deviation [SD]) of the patients was 29.0 (10.30) years, with a mean treatment duration of 13.7 (0.52) months. Although the acquisition of the IVCM total score was limited, an overall downward trend was observed in IVCM scores for each layer of the cornea. A decrease in the average of smoothed intensity was observed in four out of six patients at Week 16. Most patients reported at least 1-step improvement in physician and patient-reported photophobia assessment. Thirty-three AEs were reported in five patients (83.3%). Three patients (50.0%) reported eye and general disorders and administration site conditions. Tingling sensation was the most frequently reported local adverse drug reaction. No serious AEs or deaths were reported. Cysteamine eye drops were efficacious and well tolerated in the Japanese cystinosis patients with corneal cystine crystals.",

        "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives:</i> Inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs), primarily cystinosis, Fabry disease, and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), are genetic conditions that typically result in multi-organ disease manifestations. Kidney function progressively deteriorates in many cases, with patients eventually reaching end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and requiring renal replacement therapy. Kidney transplantation has been deemed the optimal renal replacement therapy option to achieve long-term survival in patients with IMD. Whilst improved long-term survival is expected, the patterns of clinical evolution for IMD after transplantation remain largely unknown. <i>Methods:</i> Our group conducted a retrospective observational study that included 37 adult patients with IMD (11 with cystinosis, 20 with Fabry disease, and 6 with MMA). The study evaluated the clinical status and progression of these patients following kidney transplantation between January 2010 and December 2023. <i>Results:</i> This generally resulted in good graft outcomes for patients with IMD. Standard immunosuppression regimes included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone. The mean graft survival duration was noted to be 12 years in patients with cystinosis, 11 years in patients with Fabry disease, and 7 years in patients with MMA. Suboptimal outcomes were noted with grafts of cadaveric origin and poor adherence to the prescribed post-transplant immunosuppression regime. A greater extra-renal morbidity burden was associated with a reduced duration of graft function and increased mortality in patients with IMD. <i>Conclusions:</i> Our findings emphasise the need for a multi-disciplinary approach in the care of IMD patients following kidney transplantation.",

        "abstract": "Genetic newborn screening (NBS) has already entered the phase of common practice in many countries. In Germany, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and sickle cell disease (SCD) are currently a mandatory part of NBS. Here, we describe the experience of six years of genetic NBS including the prevalence of those three diseases in Germany. Samples and nucleic acids were extracted from dried blood spot cards, commonly used for NBS. A qPCR assay was used to detect disease-causing variants for SMA and SCD, and the detection of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) was performed for SCID screening. The results of the NBS of over 1 million newborns for SMA, approximately 770,000 for SCID and over 410,000 for SCD are discussed in detail. In these newborns, we have identified 121 cases of SMA, 15 cases of SCID and syndrome-based immunodeficiencies and 77 cases of SCD or \u03b2-thalassemia. The flexibility of multiplex qPCR is assessed as an effective tool for incorporating different molecular genetic markers for screening. The processing of dried blood spot (DBS) filter cards for molecular genetic assays and the assays are described in detail; turn-around times and cost estimations are included to give an insight into the processes and discuss further options for optimization. The identified cases are in the range expected for the total number of screened newborns, but present a more exact view on the actual prevalences for Germany.",

        "abstract": "Cystinosis metabolic bone disease (CMBD) is an emerging concept in infantile nephropathic cystinosis, patients presenting with bone pains, fractures, and deformations during teenage or early adulthood. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Our aim was to explore the pro-inflammatory profile of osteoclastic lineage in cystinotic patients. We obtained blood samples from 14 cystinotic patients and 10 pediatric healthy controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and used to explore by RT-qPCR the transcript expression of 8 inflammatory markers (Il-6, Il-8, Il-1\u03b2, CXCL1, CCL2/MCP-1, CXCR3, Il-1 Receptor, Il-6 Receptor). In addition, when possible, PBMCs were differentiated into osteoclasts for further experiments. The expression of Il-6, IL-8, CXCR3, and CCL2/MCP-1 was significantly increased in PBMCs from cystinotic patients. We also explored the expression of Il-1 Receptor and Il-6 Receptor, two major pro-osteoclastic signal inducers, in osteoclasts differentiated from PBMCs from controls (N\u2009=\u20093) and patients (N\u2009=\u20094). The expression of IL-1 Receptor (but not IL-6 receptor) was increased in osteoclasts obtained from cystinotic patients. There is an inflammatory profile in PBMCs and osteoclastic lineage in cells obtained from cystinotic patients. CXCR3 and MCP-1 stimulate migration and activation of macrophages, that may explain the previously reported local increased osteoclastogenesis. The osteoclastic overexpression of IL-1 Receptor is a relevant observation in the field since blocking Il-1\u03b2 signaling has recently been proposed as a novel therapeutic approach to improve muscular wasting in this orphan disease. \u2022 Cystinosis metabolic bone disease (CMBD), an emerging concept with unclear underlying mechanisms, induces bone pains, fractures and deformations in patients with cystinosis. \u2022 Blocking Il-1\u03b2 signaling may be a novel therapeutic approach to improve muscular wasting in cystinosis. \u2022 There is an inflammatory profile in PBMCs and osteoclastic lineage in cells obtained from cystinotic patients, with an over-expression of IL-1 Receptor in osteoclasts. \u2022 We provide another experimental rationale to propose targeted anti-inflammatory therapies in cystinotic patients with severe bone disease.",

        "abstract": "Cysteamine, a drug approved to treat cystinosis, has been proposed as a host-directed therapy for <i>M. tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) and SARS-CoV-2. The impact of cysteamine on the immune responses has not been fully investigated. We aimed to <i>in vitro</i> evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of cysteamine on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using the purified protein derivative (PPD) as a recall antigen, and an unspecific stimulus as staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). PBMCs isolated from subjects with tuberculosis infection (TBI), those with tuberculosis disease (TB), and healthy controls (HC) were <i>in vitro</i> stimulated with PPD or SEB and treated or not with cysteamine at different concentrations (50 \u00b5M-400 \u00b5M) for 6 hours (h) and 24 h. We evaluated the T helper1 (Th1) and T cytotoxic1 (Tc1) cell cytokine production by flow cytometry and immune-enzymatic assays. In HC, we also evaluated apoptosis and/or necrosis by flow cytometry. We observed an immunomodulatory effect of cysteamine at 400 \u00b5M in PBMCs from TB and TBI subjects. It significantly reduced PPD-specific Th1 responses at 24 h and at 6 h (p=0.0004 and p=0.0009, respectively), and a similar non-significant trend was observed with cysteamine at 200 \u00b5M (p=0.06 at 24 h and p=0.14 at 6 h). Moreover, cysteamine at both 400 \u00b5M (p<0.0001 and p=0.0187 at 24 h, respectively, and p<0.0001 at 6 h for both) and 200 \u00b5M (p=0.0119 and p=0.0028 at 24 h and p=0.0028 and p=0.0003 at 6 h, respectively) significantly reduced SEB-induced Th1 and Tc1 responses. Furthermore, we found that cysteamine induced morphological lymphocyte changes and significantly reduced the lymphocyte percentage in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Cysteamine at 400 \u00b5M induced 8% late apoptosis and 1.6% necrosis (p<0.05) at 24 h. In contrast, despite significant differences from untreated conditions (p<0.05), cysteamine at 400 \u00b5M for 6 h induced approximately 1% late apoptosis and 0.1% necrosis in the cells. High doses of cysteamine <i>in vitro</i> reduce the percentages of PPD- and SEB-induced Th1 and Tc1 cells and induce late apoptosis and necrosis. Differently, cysteamine at lower doses retains the immunomodulatory effect without affecting cell viability. These findings suggest cysteamine as a potential adjunct to antimicrobial regimens as in the TB or COVID-19 field, for its ability to reduce the inflammatory status.",

        "abstract": "Infantile cystinosis is a rare systemic hereditary disorder characterized by abnormal cystine accumulation in cells, leading to various complications. Ophthalmological involvement is one of the major complications of this condition and significantly impacts visual prognosis. We report the case of a five-year-old male patient who was followed up for growth retardation, rickets, and refractory metabolic acidosis and was referred to ophthalmology for severe photophobia. Ophthalmological examination revealed a corrected visual acuity of 4/10 in the right eye and 8/10 in the left eye. Biomicroscopic examination showed birefringent corneal and conjunctival deposits. The diagnosis of infantile cystinosis was confirmed. Cystinosis is a lysosomal, autosomal recessive disease caused by intralysosomal cystine accumulation, manifesting ophthalmologically as cystine keratopathy and, less commonly, cystine retinopathy, which can threaten visual prognosis. The specific treatment for this condition is cysteamine, but management is multidisciplinary and must be initiated early to prevent severe complications.",

        "abstract": "Cysteamine, an aminothiol, is the only available treatment for cystinosis, an incurable metabolic recessive disease characterized by detrimental symptoms at the renal, ocular, and muscular levels. Cystinosis is due to mutations in the CTNS gene encoding for the lysosomal symporter cystinosine. Cysteamine treatment only delays the symptoms, presents undesirable side effects and the patients depend on it for life. Thus, it is of paramount importance to find new complementary therapeutic targets for the disease, as well as to understand, at the molecular level, both the beneficial and detrimental effects of cysteamine. Here, we have used ZenoSWATH DIA proteomics and clustering analysis to unravel the differences between cystinotic and non-cystinotic skin fibroblasts, and to study the effect of increasing concentrations of cysteamine. Cystinotic cells present significant differences in proteins related to extracellular matrix structure and detoxification. Only a subset of those proteins is reversed by cysteamine in a dose-dependent manner, partially providing an explanation for its therapeutic benefits. Finally, cysteamine per se alters the levels of a group of lysosomal proteins that are not modulated in basal conditions. Our results will be helpful to understand the benefits, deficiencies, and detrimental effects of the cysteamine treatment.",

This observational, single-center study aimed to explore the levels of anxiety, depression, care burden, and QoL status in caregivers of patients with nephropathic cystinosis. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale, and the Short Form-36 (SF-36) were administered to caregivers of pediatric patients with nephropathic cystinosis. Nine caregivers of pediatric patients with nephropathic cystinosis participated in the study (6 boys and 3 girls; mean age, 12.6\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2 years). All participating caregivers were the patient's mothers. Of the 9 caregivers, 6 showed anxiety/depression and 4 severe care burden. Overall, SF-36 QoL domains with a worse perception by caregivers were 'general health' and 'health change over time'. Mothers without depression/anxiety and low care burden had better QoL perception (p\u2009=\u20090.02). All caregivers with high care burden showed anxiety/depression. In our study cohort, caregivers of pediatric patients with nephropathic cystinosis showed high levels of anxiety/depression, high care burden, and impaired QoL, highlighting the importance of detecting psycho-social issues to implement strategies that relieve family stress and improve coping strategies.",

        "abstract": "Rab11 family interacting protein 4 (Rab11-FIP4) regulates endocytic trafficking. A possible role for Rab11-FIP4 in the regulation of lysosomal function has been proposed, but its precise function in the regulation of cellular homeostasis is unknown. By mRNA array and protein analysis, we found that Rab11-FIP4 is downregulated in the lysosomal storage disease cystinosis, which is caused by genetic defects in the lysosomal cystine transporter, cystinosin. Rescue of Rab11-FIP4 expression in <i>Ctns</i><sup>-/-</sup> fibroblasts re-established normal autophagosome levels and decreased LC3B-II expression in cystinotic cells. Furthermore, Rab11-FIP4 reconstitution increased the localization of the chaperone-mediated autophagy receptor LAMP2A at the lysosomal membrane. Treatment with genistein, a phytoestrogen that upregulates macroautophagy, or the CMA activator QX77 (CA77) restored Rab11-FIP4 expression levels in cystinotic cells supporting a cross-regulation between two independent autophagic mechanisms, lysosomal function and Rab11-FIP4. Improved cellular homeostasis in cystinotic cells rescued by Rab11-FIP4 expression correlated with decreased endoplasmic reticulum stress, an effect that was potentiated by Rab11 and partially blocked by expression of a dominant negative Rab11. Restoring Rab11-FIP4 expression in cystinotic proximal tubule cells increased the localization of the endocytic receptor megalin at the plasma membrane, suggesting that Rab11-FIP4 reconstitution has the potential to improve cellular homeostasis and function in cystinosis.",

The last visit data of 64 patients aged between 2 and 64 attending the centre for management of cystinosis were reviewed. Each patient had been placed into one of four categories by the clinician based on disease severity. The correlation between these categories and markers of the disease was assessed using Pearson's correlation. Photophobia (0.647, p<0.001), visual acuity (-0.695, p<0.001), Gahl's score (0.603, p<0.001), optical coherence tomography (OCT)% (0.713, p<0.001) and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM)% (0.845, p<0.001), showed a strong, highly significant correlation between key signs and symptoms and the 3C classification. Corneal complications were strongly correlated with the 3C classification with scores of 0.802 (p<0.001), 0.634 (p<0.001), 0.726 (p<0.001) and 0.677 (p<0.001) for band keratopathy, keratitis, neovascularisation and corneal ulceration, respectively. 75% of those classified as most severe had all four complications. The use of artificial tears and ciclosporin strongly correlated with the categorisation, 0.574 (p<0.001) and 0.631 (p<0.001), respectively. With all cystinosis markers, the 3C classification showed a stronger correlation than age and crystal scores by Gahl's and OCT. Category and age were strongly correlated (0.656, p<0.001). There was a moderate negative correlation with therapeutic compliance with cysteamine eye-drops and categorisation (-0.422, p<0.001). The compliance pattern observed may help to explain why the disease progresses in some patients. 3C classification is a reliable tool to categorise ocular cystinosis and can support clinical management decisions allowing more reliable comparison of datasets.",

We used both genetic and pharmacological approaches to investigate leptin signalling in Ctns<sup>-/-</sup> mice. We generated Ctns<sup>-/-</sup>Mc4r<sup>-/-</sup> double knockout mice. Bone phenotype of Ctns<sup>-/-</sup>Mc4r<sup>-/-</sup> mice, Ctns<sup>-/-</sup> mice and wild type (WT) mice at 1, 4, and 9\u00a0months of age were compared. We then treated 12-month-old Ctns<sup>-/-</sup> mice and WT mice with a pegylated leptin receptor antagonist (PLA) (7\u00a0mg/kg/day, IP), a MC4R antagonist agouti-related peptide (AgRP) (2\u00a0nmol, intracranial infusion on days 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27), or vehicle (normal saline), respectively, for 28\u00a0days. Whole-body (BMC/BMD, bone area) and femoral bone phenotype (BMC/BMD, bone area, length and failure load) of mice were measured by DXA and femoral shaft biochemical test. We also measured lean mass content by EchoMRI and muscle function (grip strength and rotarod activity) in mice. Femur protein content of JAK2 and STAT3 was measured by ELISA kits, respectively. Bone defects are present in Ctns<sup>-/-</sup> mice throughout its first year of life. The deletion of the Mc4r gene attenuated bone disorder in Ctns<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Femoral BMD, bone area, length, and strength (failure load) were significantly increased in 9-month-old Ctns<sup>-/-</sup>Mc4r<sup>-/-</sup> mice than in age-matched Ctns<sup>-/-</sup> mice. PLA and AgRP treatment significantly increased femoral bone density (BMC/BMD) and mechanical strength in 12-month-old Ctns<sup>-/-</sup> mice. We adopted the pair-feeding approach for this study to show that the protective effects of PLA or AgRP on bone phenotype are independent of their potent orexigenic effect. Furthermore, an increase in lean mass and in vivo muscle function (grip strength and rotarod activity) are associated with improvements in bone phenotype (femoral BMC/BMD and mechanical strength) in Ctns<sup>-/-</sup> mice, suggesting a muscle-bone interplay. Decreased femur protein content of JAK2 and STAT3 was evident in Ctns<sup>-/-</sup> mice. PLA or AgRP treatment attenuated femur STAT3 content in Ctns<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our findings suggest a significant role for dysregulated leptin signalling in INC-related bone disorder, either directly or potentially involving a muscle-bone interplay. Leptin signalling blockade may represent a novel approach to treating bone disease as well as muscle wasting in INC.",

Three patients also had crystal deposits in the epithelium, where epithelial cell disruption was observed. Crystal deposits around the subepithelial nerve plexus were noted in some sections. In one patient, round and needle-shaped bright deposits along with inflammatory cells were observed in the limbal region of the conjunctiva. Infrared fundus images of two female siblings revealed hyperreflective crystal-like deposits around the optic disc, macula, and peripheral retina, and enhanced depth imaging OCT showed accumulation of crystals in all layers of the retina.",

        "abstract": "Nanofibers can be utilized to overcome the challenges faced by conventional ophthalmic formulations. This study aimed to develop and characterize cysteamine (Cys)-loaded nanofiber-based ophthalmic inserts (OIs) as a potential candidate for the treatment of ophthalmic cystinosis using water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/poloxamer 407 (PO-407) and water-insoluble tetraethoxysilane (TEOS)/PVA nanofibers. Plain and Cys-loaded fibers in different proportions were prepared by the electrospinning method and studied for their morphological, physicochemical, release study, cytocompatibility effects, and stability study. The fiber formation was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, while Fourier transform infrared spectra showed the most critical peaks for the Cys and the excipients. The release of the Cys was fast from the two polymeric matrices (\u226420 min). The release from TEOS/PVA nanofibers is characterized by Case II transport (0.75 < \u03b2 < 1), while the release from PVA/PO-407 nanofibers follows Fickian diffusion (\u03b2 < 0.75). The cytocompatibility of compositions was confirmed by hen eggs tested on the chorioallantoic membrane (HET-CAM) of chick embryos. All formulations remained stable under stress conditions (40 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C, 75 \u00b1 5% relative humidity) regarding morphology and physicochemical characteristics. The developed nanofibrous mats could be an excellent alternative to available Cys drops, with better stability and convenience of self-administration as OIs.",

        "abstract": "Cystinosis is a rare autosomal recessive disorder in which cystine crystals accumulate within the cellular lysosomes, causing damage to multiple organs. Due to challenges with the stringent cysteamine treatment regimen and side effects, adherence is often sub-optimal. This study aimed to assess the level of adherence to cysteamine therapy among cystinosis patients in Saudi Arabia and its impact on their quality of life. Electronic medical record data of 39 cystinosis patients from the Department of Nephrology at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center in Saudi Arabia were reviewed, and 25 patients were included in this study. Out of the 25 patients included in the final analysis, 64% (<i>n</i> = 16) were female. The mean age was 19.04 years. Almost all patients (23/25, 92%) were on oral IR cysteamine therapy, and 52% (13/25) were on topical cysteamine eye drop treatment. Of the 15 patients who responded to the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 (MMAS-8) questionnaire, only 4 (26.7%) were highly adherent to cysteamine therapy. Most of the respondents (7/15, 46.7%) showed a medium level of treatment adherence. Based on the medication possession ratio for oral cysteamine, only 6 out of 23 patients (26.1%) were found to be 96-100% adherent. For the cysteamine eye drops, only 5/13 patients (38.4%) were 76-95% adherent. The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) used to assess patients' health-related outcomes showed that their quality of life was affected in the domains of 'social functioning' and 'energy/fatigue.' Despite a small sample size, this study shows sub-optimal adherence to cysteamine treatment in patients from Saudi Arabia. The possible reasons for low treatment adherence could be a high frequency of administration and treatment-related side effects.",

        "abstract": "Cystinosis is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by an autosomal recessive phenotype. Intermediate cystinosis, which progresses slowly and causes renal failure, accounts for approximately 5% of all cystinosis cases. Patients with intermediate cystinosis may not exhibit the typical symptoms of cystinosis, such as Fanconi syndrome and ocular symptoms. Because of its diverse clinical presentation and rarity, intermediate cystinosis can be difficult to diagnose. Additionally, few patients can tolerate cystine-depleting drugs, such as cysteamine, because of their complicated administration schedules and side effects. We report a case of intermediate cystinosis that was treated with cysteamine for 10\u00a0years. Urinary abnormalities were first diagnosed when the patient was 3\u00a0years of age during a health examination specifically for 3-year-old children, which is unique to Japan. Cystinosis was diagnosed when the patient was 12\u00a0years of age. Cysteamine therapy was initiated and regular cystine concentration measurements were performed. Although proteinuria persisted, the patient's renal function progressed slowly. Two renal biopsies were performed, and multinucleated podocytes and cystine crystals without focal segmental glomerulosclerosis lesions were observed in the biopsy specimens. The patient's renal function remained stable. This case of intermediate cystinosis was treated with cysteamine over the course of 10\u00a0years. Intermediate cystinosis requires an appropriate diagnosis and long-term treatment.",

        "abstract": "Genetic variability persists across diverse populations, and it may impact the characterization of heritable diseases in different ancestral groups. Cystinosis is a metabolic disease caused by pathogenic variants in the <i>CTNS</i> gene causing the cellular accumulation of cystine. We attempted to assess the currently poorly characterized prevalence of cystinosis by employing a population genetics methodology. However, we encountered a significant challenge due to genetic variations across different populations, and the consideration of potential disparities in access to healthcare made our results inconclusive. Pathogenic <i>CTNS</i> variants were identified in a representative global population cohort using The Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) and the 1000 Genomes (1\u00a0KG) database. The c.124G>A (p.Val42Ile) variant was reported to be pathogenic based on an observation in the white population presenting with atypical phenotypes, but it would be reclassified as benign in the African ancestral group if applying the ACMG allele frequency guideline due to its high allele frequency specifically in this population. Inclusion or exclusion of this c.124G>A (p.Val42Ile) variant results in a significant change in estimated disease prevalence, which can impact the diagnosis and treatment of affected patients with a broad range of phenotypic presentations. This observation led us to postulate that pathogenic manifestations of the disease may be underdiagnosed due to variable expressivity and systemic inequities in access to care, specifically in the African subpopulation. We call for a more cautious and inclusive approach to achieve more equitable care across diverse populations.",

        "abstract": "In infantile nephropathic cystinosis, variants of the CTNS gene cause accumulation of cystine in lysosomes, causing progressive damage to most organs. Patients usually present before 1 year of age with signs of renal Fanconi syndrome. Cysteamine therapy allows cystine clearance from lysosomes and delays kidney damage but does not prevent progression to end-stage kidney disease, suggesting that pathways unrelated to cystine accumulation are also involved. Among these, impaired autophagy, altered endolysosomal trafficking, and increased apoptosis have emerged in recent years as potential targets for new therapies. We previously showed that luteolin, a flavonoid compound, improves these abnormal pathways in cystinotic cells and in zebrafish models of the disease. Herein, we have investigated if prolonged luteolin treatment ameliorates kidney damage in a murine model of cystinosis. To this end, we have treated Ctns<sup>-/-</sup> mice from 2 to 8 months with 150\u202fmg/kg/day of luteolin. No significant side effects were observed. Compared to untreated animals, analyses of kidney cortex samples obtained after sacrifice showed that luteolin decreased p62/SQSTM1 levels (p <0.001), improved the number, size, and distribution of LAMP1-positive structures (p <0.02), and decreased tissue expression of cleaved caspase 3 (p <0.001). However, we did not observe improvements in renal Fanconi syndrome and kidney inflammation. Kidney function remained normal during the time of the study. These results indicate that luteolin has positive effects on the apoptosis and endo-lysosomal defects of cystinotic proximal tubular cells. However, these beneficial effects did not translate into improvement of renal Fanconi syndrome.",

        "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant challenge for pediatric endocrinologists, as children with CKD may present a variety of endocrine complications. Growth failure is common in CKD, and its severity is correlated with the degree of renal insufficiency. Management strategies include addressing reversible comorbidities, optimizing nutrition, and ensuring metabolic control. Kidney replacement therapy, including transplantation, determines a significant improvement in growth. According to a recent Consensus Statement, children with CKD stage 3-or on dialysis older >6 months-are eligible for treatment with recombinant growth hormone (rGH) in the case of persistent growth failure. Treatment with rGH may be considered for those with height between the 3rd and 10th percentile and persistent growth deceleration. In children who received kidney transplantation but continue to experience growth failure, initiation of GH therapy is recommended one year post-transplantation if spontaneous catch-up growth does not occur and steroid-free immunosuppression is not an option. In children with CKD, due to nephropathic cystinosis and persistent growth failure, GH therapy should be considered at all stages of CKD. Potential adverse effects and benefits must be regularly assessed during therapy. Treatment with GH is safe in children with CKD. However, its general efficacy is still controversial. All possible problems with a negative impact on growth should be timely addressed and resolved, whenever possible with a personalized approach to the patient. GH therapy may be useful in promoting catch-up growth in children with residual growth potential. Future research should focus on refining effective therapeutic strategies and establishing consensus guidelines to optimize growth outcomes in this population.",

        "abstract": "The pathophysiology of cystinosis-associated metabolic bone disease is complex. We hypothesized a disturbed interaction between osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Binational cross-sectional multicenter study. Hospital clinics. One hundred and three patients with cystinosis (61% children) with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 1-5D/T. Ten key bone markers. Skeletal complications occurred in two-thirds of the patients, with adults having a five-fold increased risk compared to children. Patients with CKD stages 1-3 showed reduced z-scores for serum phosphate and calcium, suppressed fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and parathyroid hormone levels in conjunction with elevated bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels. Serum phosphate was associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate, combined phosphate and active vitamin D treatment, and native vitamin D supplementation, while serum calcium was associated with age and dosage of active vitamin D. Sclerostin was generally elevated in children, and associated with age, FGF23 levels, and treatment with active vitamin D and growth hormone. The osteoclast marker tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b was increased, and associated with age and treatment with active vitamin D. The ratio of soluble ligand of receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB (sRANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), a surrogate for the regulation of osteoclastogenesis by osteoblasts, was decreased and associated with phosphate and 1,25(OH)2D3 levels. These changes were only partly corrected after transplantation. Bone health in cystinosis deteriorates with age, which is associated with increased osteoclast activity despite counterregulation of osteoblasts via OPG/RANKL, which in conjunction with elevated sclerostin levels and persistent rickets/osteomalacia may promote progressive bone loss.",

        "abstract": "Infectious diseases are a major threat to global health and cause millions of deaths every year, particularly in developing countries. The emergence of multidrug resistance challenges current antimicrobial treatments, inducing uncertainty in therapeutic protocols. New compounds are therefore necessary. A drug repurposing approach could play a critical role in developing new treatments used either alone or in combination with standard therapy regimens. Herein, we focused on cysteamine, an aminothiol endogenously synthesized by human cells during the degradation of coenzyme-A, which is a drug approved for the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis. Cysteamine influences many biological processes due to the presence of the highly reactive thiol group. This review provides an overview of cysteamine-mediated effects on different viruses, bacteria and parasites, with a particular focus on infections caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Evidences for a potential use of cysteamine as a direct antimicrobial agent and/or a host-directed therapy, either alone or in combination with other antimicrobial drugs, are described.",

        "title": "Ketogenic Diet and Progression of Kidney Disease in Animal Models of Nephropathic Cystinosis.",
        "abstract": "Ketogenic diet can change the metabolism in the body and helped restore the function of altered pathways in nephropathic cystinosis. Ketogenic diet had significant benefits for preventing kidney damage, even when initiated after the onset of kidney impairment. Ketogenic diet may provide a partial therapeutic alternative in countries where cysteamine therapy is too expensive. Nephropathic cystinosis is a rare inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the <i>CTNS</i> gene that encodes for cystinosin, a lysosomal cystine/H<sup>+</sup> symporter. From the standpoint of the kidneys, patients develop early-onset renal Fanconi syndrome and progressive CKD. Current therapy with cysteamine delays but does not prevent kidney failure and has significant side effects that limit adherence and reduce the quality of life of patients. We have tested biochemically and histologically the effects of ketogenic diet on kidney disease of two animal models of nephropathic cystinosis. When <i>Ctns</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice were fed with ketogenic diet from 3 to 12 months of age, we observed significant nearly complete prevention of Fanconi syndrome, including low molecular weight proteinuria, glycosuria, and polyuria. Compared with wild-type animals, BUN at 12 months was higher in cystinotic mice fed with standard diet (<i>P</i> < 0.001), but not with ketogenic diet. At sacrifice, kidneys of knockout mice fed with ketogenic diet appeared macroscopically similar to those of wild-type animals, which was reflected microscopically by a significant reduction of interstitial cell infiltration (CD3 and CD68 positive cells, <i>P</i> < 0.01), of interstitial fibrosis (Masson and <i>\u03b1</i>-smooth muscle actin staining, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and of apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3 levels; <i>P</i> < 0.001), and by indirect evidence of restoration of a normal autophagic flux (SQSTM1/p62 and LC3-II expression, <i>P</i> < 0.05). Beneficial effects of ketogenic diet on tubular function were also observed after mice were fed with this ketogenic diet from the age of 6 months to the age of 15 months, after they had developed proximal tubular dysfunction. Although slightly less pronounced, these results were replicated in <i>Ctns</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> rats fed with ketogenic diet from 2 to 8 months of life. These results indicate significant mitigation of the kidney phenotype in cystinotic animals fed with ketogenic diet.",

        "abstract": "G6PD deficiency (G6PDd) is the most common X-linked genetic disease worldwide and the most common cause of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (NH) in Nigeria. Screening for G6PDd has been recommended for over thirty years but is still not routinely done in Nigeria. We sought to investigate a low-cost rapid diagnostic test to determine G6PDd in Nigerian neonates. Enrolled neonates were screened using the CareStartTM G6PD point-of-care rapid diagnostic test; and mothers/caregivers of neonates with G6PDd were asked about their cord care product(s); transcutaneous bilirubin levels were done on neonates with G6PDd using the JM 103 meter. One hundred and forty neonates were enrolled between 15 January and 1 July 2022. Eighteen (12.8%) of all neonates enrolled and 13.9% of enrolled males (0% of females) were G6PDd. Seventeen of the mothers/caregivers of the G6PDd neonates were asked about cord care. The majority of mothers/caregivers (15/17, 88%%) reported including methylated spirits in their neonate's cord care; seven of these used chlorohexidine plus methylated spirits (41.2%) while only one mother/caregiver used chlorohexidine alone. One mother/caregiver used mentholatum alone and another used mentholatum, chlorhexidine gel, and methylated spirits. Maximum bilirubin levels for those infants with G6PDd ranged from 3.2 to 18.8\u2009mg/dl with 16/17 (94.1%) of bilirubin levels exceeding 5.5\u2009mg/dl. This study again highlights the need for large-scale G6PDd screening. Additionally, it highlights the need to correlate the type of cord care with the risk of NH in future studies.",

        "abstract": "Crigler-Najjar Syndrome (CNS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the <i>UGT1A1</i> gene, leading to impaired bilirubin conjugation and severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. CNS presents in the following forms: CNS type 1 (CNS1), the more severe form with the complete absence of <i>UGT1A1</i> activity, and CNS type 2 (CNS2), with partial enzyme activity. This narrative review aims to provide a detailed overview of CNS, highlighting its clinical significance and the need for new, more effective treatments. By summarizing current knowledge and discussing future treatments, this article seeks to encourage further research and advancements that can improve outcomes for CNS patients. The literature analysis showed that CNS1 requires aggressive management, including phototherapy and plasmapheresis, but liver transplantation (LT) remains the only definitive cure. The timing of LT is critical, as it must be performed before the onset of irreversible brain damage (kernicterus), making early intervention essential. However, LT poses risks such as graft rejection and lifelong immunosuppression. CNS2 is milder, with patients responding well to phenobarbital and having a lower risk of kernicterus. Recent advancements in gene therapy and autologous hepatocyte transplantation offer promising alternatives to LT. Gene therapy using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors has shown potential in preclinical studies, though challenges remain in pediatric applications due to liver growth and pre-existing immunity. Autologous hepatocyte transplantation avoids the risk of rejection but requires further research. These emerging therapies provide hope for more effective and less invasive treatment options, aiming to improve the quality of life for CNS patients and reduce reliance on lifelong interventions.",

        "abstract": "Background Neonatal jaundice, characterized by the yellow discoloration of an infant's skin and eyes, is a common condition that affects\u00a0newborns. It results from an elevated level of bilirubin in the blood and,\u00a0when severe, if left untreated, can lead to complications such as acute bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus, which can cause permanent neurological damage or even death. In low-resource settings like Nigeria, delayed recognition and inadequate management of neonatal jaundice are significant contributors to neonatal morbidity and mortality. Parental knowledge and attitudes play a critical role in the early identification and timely intervention of neonatal jaundice. However, there is limited data on the awareness, understanding, and practices of parents regarding this condition in many regions, including Abia State, Nigeria.\u00a0 Aim This study sought to assess the knowledge and attitudes of parents at Abia State Children's Specialist Hospital, Umuahia, Nigeria, to inform strategies for improving early detection and management of neonatal jaundice. Research methodology This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at Abia State Children's Specialist Hospital. The study population included 385 parents (fathers and mothers) of neonates attending the pediatric and neonatal units. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select participants. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25, (Released 2017; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). Results The study revealed that 226 (58.70%) of parents had heard about neonatal jaundice, with the main perceived cause being an immature liver (148, 38.44%). While 216 (56.10%) of the parents recognized neonatal jaundice as a serious condition when severe, only 72 (18.70%) were very confident in identifying its signs. Most parents (369, 95.84%) would seek medical help if they suspected jaundice in their baby, yet 288 (74.81%) believed in the effectiveness of traditional remedies. Educational level and gender were significantly associated with knowledge about neonatal jaundice (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively). Conclusion The findings highlight a moderate level of awareness but varying confidence in identifying neonatal jaundice among parents. The reliance on traditional remedies suggests a need for enhanced health education to improve knowledge of and attitudes toward neonatal jaundice management.",

        "title": "Controversies in our understanding of extreme hyperbilirubinemia in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient neonates.",
        "abstract": "Despite declarations that kernicterus should be a \"never-event\", the condition continues to occur, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficiency being a leading cause. In this paper, we address some controversies regarding the pathophysiology and the potential for extreme hyperbilirubinemia associated with G6PD-deficiency. We present evidence to demonstrate that G6PD-deficiency-associated neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is no longer limited to countries and geographic regions to which the condition was indigenous, but is also encountered in North America and other Western countries with a low inherent G6PD-deficiency frequency. Pathophysiologically, while a diminished bilirubin conjugative component is undoubtedly present, we present evidence that there is a component of increased hemolysis as well, contributing to the extreme, exponential hyperbilirubinemia associated with G6PD-deficiency. Extreme hyperbilirubinemia in G6PD heterozygotes, while less frequent than in male hemizygotes or female deficient homozygotes, has been reported, suggesting previous underestimation of the risks of heterozygosity. Universal neonatal screening for G6PD-deficiency, while not expected to prevent acute, episodic hyperbilirubinemia, should increase awareness, thereby facilitating earlier referral for treatment, prior to the onset of bilirubin encephalopathy. Finally, we speculate as to what the future looks like for babies with G6PD-deficiency, potential therapeutic stratagems, and the effect of G6PD-deficiency on medical conditions beyond the realm of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. IMPACT STATEMENTS: G6PD-deficiency is encountered in North America and Western countries previously thought to have a low frequency of the condition. Extreme, sudden neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is due, in the main, to increased hemolysis, an independent risk factor for neurotoxicity. Extreme hyperbilirubinemia may follow apparently resolved neonatal hyperbilirubinemia which had been treated by phototherapy. Female G6PD heterozygotes, previously thought to be unaffected clinically by G6PD-deficiency, while at low risk, may, nevertheless, develop extreme hyperbilirubinemia. Universal neonatal G6PD screening should be aimed towards increasing caretaker awareness and facilitating referral for treatment prior to the onset of bilirubin encephalopathy.",

        "abstract": "Debate exists regarding predictive value of brain MRI for long-term neurodevelopmental outcome (NDO) in infants with severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (above exchange transfusion levels). To investigate whether MRI findings among (pre-)term infants with severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can predict NDO at\u00a0\u2265\u00a012 months and determine optimal timing for MRI. PubMed and Embase. Last update: June 14, 2024. Studies in which (pre-)term infants with severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia who underwent an MRI before 24 months and had a reported NDO at\u00a0\u2265\u00a012 months were included. Patient characteristics, MRI and NDO details were extracted. The search yielded 732 studies, of which 22 were included. Individual patient information was obtained for 120 infants (MRI-timing: early (\u22646 weeks) n\u00a0=\u00a075, late (>6 weeks) n\u00a0=\u00a019, unknown n\u00a0=\u00a026). Positive predictive value (PPV) of abnormal MRI in the total group for impaired NDO was high (77.5\u00a0%). The PPV of late compared to early MRI was much higher, 92.3\u00a0% versus 71.7\u00a0%. Negative predictive value of normal MRI for normal NDO in the total group was low (29.0\u00a0%) and again higher in late compared to early MRI, 50.0\u00a0% versus 27.3\u00a0%. Quantitative synthesis of results was impossible due to large heterogeneity in study designs. Furthermore, selection bias towards patients with impaired outcome might have influenced our results. Brain MRI can serve as prognostic tool for NDO in infants with severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, both in early and late stages, but each timing has inherent constraints. Further prospective studies are necessary.",

        "abstract": "Severe Neonatal Jaundice (SNJ) causes long-term neurocognitive impairment, cerebral palsy, auditory neuropathy, deafness, or death. We developed a mathematical model for allo-hemodialysis as a potential blood purification method for the treatment of SNJ in term or near-term infants. With allo-hemodialysis (allo-HD), the neonate's blood flows through hollow fibers of a miniature 0.075 m<sup>2</sup> hemodialyzer, while the blood of a healthy adult (\"buddy\") flows counter-currently through the dialysate compartment. We simulated the kinetics of unconjugated bilirubin in allo-hemodialysis with neonate blood flow rates of 12.5 and 15\u00a0mL/min (for a 2.5\u00a0kg and 3.5\u00a0kg neonate, respectively), and 30\u00a0mL/min for the buddy. Bilirubin production rates in neonate and buddy were set to 6 and 3\u00a0mg/kg/day, respectively. Buddy bilirubin conjugation rate was calculated to obtain normal steady-state bilirubin levels. Albumin levels were set to 1.1, 2.1, 3.1\u00a0g/dL for the neonate and 3.3\u00a0g/dL for the buddy. Model simulations suggest that a 6-h allo-hemodialysis session could reduce neonatal bilirubin levels by\u2009>\u200935% and that this modality would be particularly effective with low neonatal serum albumin levels. Due to the high bilirubin conjugation capacity of an adult's healthy liver and the larger distribution volume, the buddy's bilirubin level increases only transiently during allo-hemodialysis. Our modelling suggests that a single allo-hemodialysis session may lower neonatal unconjugated bilirubin levels effectively. If corroborated in ex-vivo, animal, and clinical studies, this bilirubin reduction could lower the risks associated with SNJ, especially kernicterus, and possibly avoiding the morbidity associated with exchange transfusions.",

        "abstract": "Prevention of neonatal bilirubin injury exemplifies success of systems approach to avert adverse neonatal and childhood outcomes that rely on strategies including prenatal identification of Rhesus sensitization, universal maternal blood typing, risk assessment for neonatal extreme hyperbilirubinemia (EHB), unfettered access to safe, effective phototherapy, and application of patient safety principles. India's diverse landscape suggests varied real-time experiences of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and consequent infant mortality rates (IMR). Utilizing Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database, the authors examined national and subnational trends, infant mortality timing, and the disease burden from hemolytic and perinatal jaundice over 30 y (1999 to 2019). They also assessed the correlation of EHB-IMR with socio-demographic index and health expenditure per capita, estimating economic losses from EHB-related infant mortality to guide policy decisions at national and state domains. From 1990 to 2019, India delivered 811,078,415 livebirths of which, 1,189,856 infant deaths were due to EHB. EHB-related deaths decreased from 57,773 in 1990 to 19,664 in 2019, a 60% reduction vs. 40% in overall IMR. Early (0-6 d), late (7-27 d), and post-neonatal (28-364 d) deaths accounted for 61%, 34%, and 5% of mortality, respectively. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar contributed to 38% of all EHB deaths. Economic analysis estimate losses between US $7.2 and 11.7 billion for the year 2019 secondary to EHB-related mortality. The present analysis reveals consistent declines across all states to reach current EHB-IMR of 0.8 per 1,000 live-births in India by 2019. Significant economic impact of lost human productivity highlight ongoing need for targeted life-saving public health strategies.",

        "abstract": "Over 3000 infants suffer a brain injury around the time of birth every year in England. Although these injuries can have important implications for children and their families, our understanding of how these injuries affect children's lives is limited. The aim of the CHERuB study (Childhood Health and Educational outcomes afteR perinatal Brain injury) is to investigate longitudinal childhood health and educational outcomes after perinatal brain injury through the creation of a population-matched cohort study. This study will use the Department of Health and Social Care definition of perinatal brain injury which includes infants with intracranial haemorrhage, preterm white matter injury, hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, perinatal stroke, central nervous system infections, seizures and kernicterus. All children born with a perinatal brain injury in England between 2008 and 2019 will be included (n=54\u2009176) and two matched comparator groups of infants without brain injury will be created: a preterm control group identified from the National Neonatal Research Data Set and a term/late preterm control group identified using birth records. The national health, education and social care records of these infants will be linked to ascertain their longitudinal childhood outcomes between 2008 and 2023. This cohort will include approximately 170\u2009000 children. The associations between perinatal brain injuries and survival without neurosensory impairment, neurodevelopmental impairments, chronic health conditions and mental health conditions throughout childhood will be examined using regression methods and time-to-event analyses. This study has West London Research Ethics Committee and Confidential Advisory Group approval (20/LO/1023 and 22/CAG/0068 issued 20/10/2022). Findings will be published in open-access journals and publicised via the CHERuB study website, social media accounts and our charity partners.",

        "abstract": "Exchange transfusion (ET) is an effective treatment for acute bilirubin encephalopathy and extreme neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (ENH). It can reduce mortality and morbidity. This study aimed to investigate the trends and risk factors of ENH requiring ET in hospitalized neonates in Iran. A retrospective analysis of medical records of neonates who underwent ET due to ENH was conducted from 2011 to 2021, in Shiraz, Iran. Clinical records were used to gather demographic and laboratory data. The quantitative data were expressed as mean\u00b1SD, and qualitative data was presented as frequency and percentage. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. During the study, 377 ETs were performed for 329 patients. The annual rate of ET decreased by 71.2% during the study period. The most common risk factor of ENH was glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (35%), followed by prematurity (13.06%), ABO hemolytic disease (7.6%), sepsis (6.4%), Rh hemolytic disease (6.08%), and minor blood group incompatibility (3.34%). In 28.52% of the cases, the cause of ENH was not identified. 17 (5.1%) neonates had acute bilirubin encephalopathy, of whom 6 (35.29%) had G6PD deficiency, 6 (35.29%) had ABO incompatibility, and 2 (11.76%) had Rh incompatibility. Although the rate of ET occurrence has decreased, it seems necessary to consider different risk factors and appropriate guidelines for early identification and management of neonates at risk of ENH should be developed. The findings of the study highlighted the important risk factors of ENH in southern Iran, allowing for the development of appropriate prevention strategies.",

Acute bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus are rare yet debilitating sequelae of severe hyperbilirubinemia that can be avoided through careful monitoring and treatment with phototherapy. Appropriate management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia must balance the risks of these severe conditions with the effects of overtreatment.

        "abstract": "The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Canadian Paediatric Society both advise that all newborns should undergo bilirubin screening before leaving the hospital, and this has become the standard practice in both countries. However, the US Preventive Task Force has found no strong evidence to suggest that this practice of universal screening for bilirubin reduces the occurrence of significant outcomes such as bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction or kernicterus. To evaluate the effectiveness of transcutaneous screening compared to visual inspection for hyperbilirubinemia to prevent the readmission of newborns (infants greater than 35 weeks' gestation) for phototherapy. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and ISRCTN in June 2023. We also searched conference proceedings, and the reference lists of included studies. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomized, cluster-randomized, or prospective cohort studies with control arm that evaluated the use of transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) screening for hyperbilirubinemia in newborns before hospital discharge. We used standard methodologic procedures expected by Cochrane. We evaluated treatment effects using a fixed-effect model with risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for categorical data and mean, standard deviation (SD), and mean difference (MD) for continuous data. We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the certainty of evidence. We identified one RCT that met our inclusion criteria. The study included 1858 African newborns at 35 weeks' gestation or greater who were receiving routine care at a well-baby nursery, and were randomly recruited prior to discharge to undergo TcB screening. The study had good methodologic quality. TcB screening versus visual assessment of hyperbilirubinemia in newborns: - probably reduces readmission to the hospital for hyperbilirubinemia (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.46; P < 0.0001; moderate-certainty evidence); - may have little or no effect on the rate of exchange transfusion (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 14.16; low-certainty evidence); - probably increases the number of newborns who require phototherapy prior to discharge (RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.56 to 4.55; moderate-certainty evidence). - may have little or no effect on the rate of acute bilirubin encephalopathy (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.18; low-certainty evidence). The study did not evaluate or report cost of care. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that TcB screening probably reduces hospital readmission for hyperbilirubinemia compared to visual inspection. Low-certainty evidence also suggests that TcB screening may have little or no effect on the rate of exchange transfusion compared to visual inspection. However, moderate-certainty evidence suggests that TcB screening probably increases the number of newborns that require phototherapy before discharge compared to visual inspection. Low-certainty evidence suggests that TcB screening may have little or no effect on the rate of acute bilirubin encephalopathy compared to visual inspection. Given that we have only identified one RCT, further studies are necessary to determine whether TcB screening can help to reduce readmission and complications related to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. In settings with limited newborn follow-up after hospital discharge, identifying newborns at risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia before hospital discharge will be important to plan targeted follow-up of these infants.",

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between electroencephalography (EEG) findings and two-year prognosis in neonates with severe hyperbilirubinemia. In a cohort prospective study, we studied neonates with a total serum bilirubin level of higher than 18\u00a0mg/dL, who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Ghaem hospital, Mashhad, Iran. EEG was recorded upon admission, for all neonates. Patients' data, including demographic characteristics, admission information, and pregnancy and birth data were gathered by obtaining history from parents and studying case files. Also, the relationship between initial EEG findings and final developmental status was assessed. Mean and standard deviation age of patients were 5.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.13\u00a0days and average serum total bilirubin level was 23.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.34\u00a0mg/dL at admission. Our findings revealed a significant correlation between the presence of trace alternant on EEG and developmental delay (P\u00a0=\u00a0.001). Presence of trace alternant waves on initial EEG at admission was significantly associated with developmental delay in the two year (P\u00a0=\u00a0.005). These results indicate a relationship between developmental prognosis and the severity of hyper bilirubinemia in neonates. Also, our findings show that the presence of trace alternate waves on the initial EEG is significantly associated with developmental delay of the neonate in the future.",

        "abstract": "Regarding the close association between neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and occurrence of pathological jaundice as a cause of neurotoxicity and kernicterus, the present study aimed to evaluate the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in neonates with hyperbilirubinemia. A retrospective case-control study of blood group O mothers and their ABO and Rh newborns was conducted. Medical records that included total serum bilirubin levels of 79 patients with hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) from between 2017 and 2020 were reviewed. Neonates who were eligible to receive immunoglobulin based on the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines were classified as cases and the rest were included as the Control Group. The mean total bilirubin in relation to hemoglobin levels in IVIG-treated neonates was significantly lower than in non-IVIG-treated neonates (13.98 \u00b1 4.23 mg/dL versus 16.61 \u00b1 2.68 mg/dL; p-value = 0.002). Although females had longer hospitalizations in both IVIG-treated (3.81 \u00b1 1.28 versus 3.54 \u00b1 1.30 days; p-value = 0.509) and non-IVIG-treated (3.43 \u00b1 0.811 versus 3.19 \u00b1 0.75 days; p-value = 0.361) groups compared to males, this difference was not significant between the groups. Although four neonates with ABO incompatibility required packed red blood cells, all infants were managed medically and no deaths occurred during the course of treatment. Moreover, no exchange transfusion or adverse effects of IVIG were observed. The results from the present study revealed that IVIG administration is a useful procedure for the management of bilirubin encephalopathy with greater opportunity to reduce exchange transfusion requirements for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.",

        "abstract": "Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an essential component for brain development during fetal and early postnatal life. Hyperbilirubinemia is characterized by abnormally high levels of bilirubin in the bloodstream, frequently leading to jaundice in newborns. In severe instances, this condition can progress to neurological damage or kernicterus, a form of brain damage. Initial cell-based experiments conducted by our research team revealed that DHA significantly enhances the survival rate of nerve cells treated with bilirubin and diminishes the oxidative stress indicated by reduced peroxide activity caused by unconjugated bilirubin (UCB). Further investigations through animal studies demonstrated that DHA effectively mitigates bilirubin-induced brain injury in neonatal rats. However, the potential of DHA to decrease the incidence of bilirubin-induced brain damage in clinical settings has not been previously explored or reported. Infants with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (n = 30 per group) participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel study. They received either 100 mg/d DHA or placebo syrup immediately when they were diagnosed. The study found that the bilirubin level at 48 hours of treatment, serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels, mean phototherapy duration, and abnormal rate of cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were lower in the DHA group than those in the control group (<i>P</i> < .05). These results suggested that DHA is effective as an adjuvant treatment for hyperbilirubinemia in children. It can reduce the incidence of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia brain injury and plays a certain protective role. Clinical study on protective effect of DHA on neonatal bilirubin injury is registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry as ChiCTR2300070250.",

        "abstract": "Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is part of the everyday life of the neonatal period as it reflects the adaptation of the metabolism of bilirubin. The neonatal hyperbilirubinemia usually resolves spontaneously, but it can also be the cause of an acute or chronic encephalopathy known as kernicterus. Regardless of the cause, the goal of therapy is to prevent this neurotoxicity while not causing undue harm. Phototherapy and, if it is unsuccessful, exchange transfusion (ECT)\u00a0remain the primary treatment modalities used to keep the maximal total serum bilirubin (TSB) below pathologic levels. This is a descriptive retrospective cohort study of 69 live neonates hospitalized in the Department of Neonatology and Neonatal Resuscitation of Mohammed VI University Hospital with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia requiring ECT and treated with intensive phototherapy instead, spanning five years from March 2016 to March 2021. We aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of phototherapy in achieving prolonged reduction of bilirubin levels and the prevention of neurological complications and to compare our results with those in the literature. The use of intensive phototherapy in the treatment of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is very effective in lowering total serum bilirubin when its level is in the range of exchange transfusion, and it has succeeded in preventing the neurological complications of severe hyperbilirubinemia. Through this study, it can be seen that phototherapy is an efficacious, simpler, and less hazardous alternative to exchange transfusion in achieving a sustained reduction of bilirubin levels and preventing neurological complications.",

        "abstract": "Dystonia is a movement disorder defined by involuntary muscle contractions leading to abnormal postures or twisting and repetitive movements. Classically dystonia has been thought of as a disorder of the basal ganglia, but newer results in idiopathic dystonia and lesion-induced dystonia in adults point to broader motor network dysfunction spanning the basal ganglia, cerebellum, premotor cortex, sensorimotor, and frontoparietal regions. It is unclear whether a similar network is shared between different etiologies of pediatric lesion-induced dystonia. Three cohorts of pediatric patients with lesion-induced dystonia were identified. The lesion etiologies included hypoxia, kernicterus, and stroke versus comparison subjects with acquired lesions not associated with dystonia. Multivariate lesion-symptom mapping and lesion network mapping were used to evaluate the anatomy and networks associated with dystonia. Multivariate lesion-symptom mapping showed that lesions of the putamen (stroke: r = 0.50, p <0.01; hypoxia, r = 0.64, p <0.001) and globus pallidus (kernicterus, r = 0.61, p <0.01) were associated with dystonia. Lesion network mapping using normative connectome data from healthy children demonstrated that these regional findings occurred within a common brain-wide network that involves the basal ganglia, anterior and medial cerebellum, and cortical regions that overlap the cingulo-opercular and somato-cognitive-action networks. We interpret these findings as novel evidence for a unified dystonia brain network that involves the somato-cognitive-action network, which is involved in higher order coordination of movement. Elucidation of this network gives insight into the functional origins of dystonia and provides novel targets to investigate for therapeutic intervention.",

        "abstract": "Hereditary TTP (hTTP), termed Upshaw-Schulman syndrome, is an ultra-rare disorder caused by a severe deficiency of plasma ADAMTS13 activity that allows circulation of ultra-large von Willebrand factor (UL-VWF) multimers. The greatest risk for hTTP is in their first days after birth, when 35-50% of patients will have severe hemolysis, jaundice, and thrombocytopenia. It is often fatal without effective treatment. In utero, fetal blood flowing from the pulmonary artery through the ductus arteriosus (DA) to the aorta is under low-shear-force. At birth, blood flow through the DA reverses to a left-to-right shunt, and the diameter of the DA begins to decrease due to hyper-oxygenated blood and decreased plasma prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>. This causes turbulent circulation that unfolds UL-VWF, allowing platelet aggregation. If the DA closes promptly, hTTP newborns survive, but if it remains patent, turbulent circulation persists, triggering microvascular thrombosis. hTTP is commonly diagnosed as hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) caused by anti-red cell antibodies and treated with exchange blood transfusion, which prevents kernicterus even when the diagnosis of hTTP is missed. The diagnosis of newborn-onset hTTP should be considered because HDFN does not cause severe thrombocytopenia, which might be effectively treated with recombinant ADAMTS13.",

        "abstract": "Raised serum bilirubin levels can cause kernicterus, and premature infants are at increased risk owing to metabolic immaturity. The standard treatment for neonatal jaundice is phototherapy, but probiotics alone can reduce the duration of phototherapy and hospitalisation. To determine the effectiveness of phototherapy with and without probiotics for the treatment of indirect hyperbilirubinaemia in preterm neonates. The open-labelled randomised controlled trial was conducted from January 2022 to January 2023 in the neonatal unit of the University of Lahore Teaching Hospital, Pakistan. A total of 76 preterm neonates who fulfilled the selection criteria were included and divided into two groups. Both groups received standard phototherapy. In Group B, a probiotic (<i>Saccharomyces boulardii</i>) 125\u2009mg, twice daily, orally (in 5 cc of whichever milk the infant was receiving) was given until discharge from hospital. The primary outcome measurements were the duration of phototherapy and the length of hospitalisation. The mean (SD) duration of phototherapy was 36.55 (14.25) hours in Group A and 24.61 (9.25) hours in Group B (<i>p</i>\u2009<0.05). The mean (SD) duration of hospital stay was 47.36 (16.51) hours in Group A and 33.13 (8.93) hours in Group B (<i>p</i>\u2009<0.05). Oral probiotics (<i>Saccharomyces boulardii</i>) have a significant effect on the duration of phototherapy for neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, and they decrease the chances of nosocomial infection. Exploration of clinical outcomes by investigating faecal flora and undertaking large randomised controlled trials of various probiotics are needed.

        "abstract": "Neonatal Jaundice is a common occurrence in neonates. High excess bilirubin would lead to hyperbilirubinemia, leading to irreversible adverse damage such as kernicterus. Therefore, it is necessary and important to monitor neonates' bilirubin levels in real-time for immediate intervention. However, current screening protocols have their inherent limitations, necessitating more convenient measurements. In this proof-of-concept study, we evaluated the feasibility of using machine learning for the screening of hyperbilirubinemia in neonates from smartphone-acquired photographs. Different machine learning models were compared and evaluated to gain a better understanding of feature selection and model performance in bilirubin determination. An in vitro study was conducted with a bilirubin-containing tissue phantom to identify potential biological and environmental confounding factors. The findings of this study present a systematic characterization of the confounding effect of various factors through separate parametric tests. These tests uncover potential techniques in image pre-processing, highlighting important biological features (light scattering property and skin thickness) and external features (ISO, lighting conditions and white balance), which together contribute to robust model approaches for accurately determining bilirubin concentrations. By obtaining an accuracy of 0.848 in classification and 0.812 in regression, these findings indicate strong potential in aiding in the design of clinical studies using patient-derived images.",

Although prematurity and low birth weight are common causes in developed countries, birth asphyxia, kernicterus, and infections have been identified as predominant etiologies in Africa. There is, however, very little information on the etiology of CP in South Africa. We aimed to determine the etiology, severity, and topographic distribution of CP in children undergoing orthopedic surgery at our tertiary pediatric unit. A retrospective folder review was performed for patients with CP who underwent orthopedic surgery from July 2018 to June 2022. Data were collected on perinatal circumstances, etiologic risk factors for developing CP, severity of disability as classified by the Gross Motor Function Classification Scale (GMFCS), and topographic distribution. Descriptive analysis was performed. A total of 202 patients were included in the analysis. Prematurity (gestational age less than 37\u00a0weeks) was noted in 41.6% of the cohort and was the most common risk factor. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (30.7%), postnatal infections (13.4%), congenital brain malformations (10.4%), and cerebral infections were the next most common etiologic risk factors. Forty-eight percent of patients were classified as GMFCS IV or V. There was a predominance of bilateral (69.5%) compared with unilateral (21.3%) subtypes. Most patients undergoing orthopedic surgery for musculoskeletal sequelae of CP had GMFCS levels of IV or V and were bilateral subtypes, emphasizing the need for intervention at a primary care level to decrease the incidence of this frequently preventable condition.",

Several different events concur to damage mainly the neurons among which inflammation and alteration of the redox state play a major role. An imbalance of cellular calcium homeostasis has been recently described to be associated with toxic concentrations of bilirubin, and this disequilibrium may in turn elicit an inflammatory reaction. The different and age-dependent sensitivity to bilirubin damage must also be considered in describing the dramatic clinical picture of bilirubin-induced neurological damage (BIND) formerly known as kernicterus spectrum disorder (KSD). This review aims to critically address what is known and what is not in the molecular events of bilirubin neurotoxicity to provide hints for a better diagnosis and more successful treatments.

        "title": "Experiences with neonatal jaundice management in hospitals and the community: interviews with Australian health professionals.",
        "abstract": "Worldwide, neonatal jaundice accounts for considerable morbidity and mortality. Although severe adverse outcomes, such as hyperbilirubinaemia and kernicterus, are uncommon in high-income countries, these outcomes do occur, have enormous lifelong personal, health and social costs, and may be preventable. Evidence-based practice commonly relies on clinical guidelines; however, their implementation can be difficult. Implementation of neonatal jaundice care has been adversely affected by issues with professional boundaries, competing professional priorities and poor understanding of neonatal jaundice. This paper focuses on the perceptions and experiences of Australian health professionals involved in the management of neonatal jaundice. Using a qualitative descriptive approach, semistructured interviews were undertaken to gain understanding of the experiences of health professionals in Australia across the scope of care for jaundiced newborns through an interpretivist approach and to identify possible gaps in the delivery of evidence-based care. Health professionals from a range of disciplines and care settings were recruited by purposive maximum variation sampling. Interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone with detailed notes taken and a field journal maintained. Interview scripts were verified by participants and imported into NVivo software. Data were analysed for major themes according to type and contexts of practice. Forty-one health professionals from six broad discipline areas were interviewed. Two major themes and explanatory subthemes were found. The first theme, <i>falling through the gaps</i>, highlighted gaps in evidence-based care, as described by four explanatory subthemes: professional boundaries, blindness to possibility of adverse outcomes, competing professional development priorities and unintended consequences.The second major theme, <i>we know what should happen-but how?,</i> described participant perceptions that it was known what was required to improve care but how to achieve such changes was unclear. The two subthemes are: improvements in education and training, and standardised policies and protocols. Multiple barriers to the provision of evidence-based care related to neonatal jaundice management are experienced by health professionals in Australia. Clinical guidelines are not sufficient to support health professionals deliver evidence-based care in the complex contexts in which they work. Implementation strategies for evidence-based practice need to take account of the experiences of health professionals and the challenges they face. Such strategies need to focus on improving collaboration between different disciplines for the well-being of those needing care. In the case of neonatal jaundice management, consideration is also needed in how to raise awareness of the importance of avoiding severe adverse outcomes, even when they might be rare, and how this might be done. Addressing issues that lead to disjointed care or poor knowledge of neonatal jaundice among health professionals is essential.",

        "abstract": "The regressed arms of reversed replication forks exhibit structural similarities to one-ended double-stranded breaks and need to be protected against uncontrolled nucleolytic degradation. Here, we identify MSANTD4 (Myb/SANT-like DNA-binding domain-containing protein 4), a functionally uncharacterized protein that uniquely counters the replication protein A (RPA)-Bloom (BLM)/Werner syndrome helicase (WRN)-DNA replication helicase/nuclease 2 (DNA2) complex to safeguard reversed replication forks from detrimental degradation, independently of the breast cancer susceptibility proteins (BRCA1/2)-DNA repair protein RAD51 pathway. MSANTD4 specifically interacts with the junctions between single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in DNA substrates harboring a 3' overhang, which resemble the structural features of regressed arms processed by WRN-DNA2. This DNA-binding capability allows MSANTD4 to accumulate at reversed forks, strategically antagonizing the RPA-BLM/WRN-DNA2 complex by impeding its access to the ssDNA-dsDNA junction of the regressed arms. Loss of MSANTD4 exacerbates genome instability induced by replication stress in BRCA1/2-deficient cells. Our findings unveil a collaborative defense mechanism orchestrated by MSANTD4 and BRCA1/2-RAD51, effectively counteracting nucleolytic attacks on the regressed arms and synergistically preserving the integrity of reversed forks.",

        "abstract": "DNA helicases play a pivotal role in maintaining genome integrity by unwinding the DNA double helix and are often considered promising targets for drug development. However, assessing specific DNA helicase activity in living cells remains challenging. Herein, the first anchor-embedded duplex (ATED) probe, 17GC, is constructed to uniquely monitor the unwinding activity of Werner syndrome helicase (WRN), a clinical anticancer target. This probe integrates biophysical screening and molecular simulation approaches. The 17GC probe consists of two components: the first one is a bubble structure as an anchor for recruiting WRN in cells, and the second one is GC-rich double helices on both ends of the bubble, which allow high sensitivity in detecting WRN activity. In vitro evaluations demonstrate that 17GC is highly sensitive and specific to WRN (LOD = 33.5 pm) compared to a wide range of other enzymes, including helicases and nucleases. Cellular evaluation reveals that the ATED probe exhibits remarkable performance in monitoring WRN helicase activity and assessing the inhibitory efficiency of clinical WRN inhibitors in various cell types. This study introduces a novel approach for designing specific and sensitive probes for DNA helicases in cells, which holds promise for biological characterization and drug development.",

As refractory skin ulcers significantly affect the quality of life of patients with WS, this study identified ulcer risk factors and assessed prevention methods. We analyzed the data of 51 patients with WS enrolled in the Japanese Werner Syndrome Registry between 2016 and 2022. A cross-sectional analysis was performed to determine the association with skin ulcers at baseline. Statistical analyses were conducted, including Welch's and Pearson's chi-square tests. Age was adjusted using a logistic regression model. The mean patient age was 48.8\u00b17.6 years, and 66.7% of patients presented with skin ulcers. Univariate analysis showed that patients with skin ulcers were older than those without ulcers. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was higher in patients with skin ulcers. Patients without skin ulcers received metformin and pioglitazone treatment significantly more often than those with ulcers. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age showed that higher SBP remained a significant risk factor for skin ulcers. Patients administered pioglitazone had lower ulcer morbidity. Age and SBP are risk factors for skin ulcers in patients with WS. Moreover, pioglitazone treatment may prevent skin ulcers.",

        "abstract": "Werner syndrome RecQ helicase (WRN), a member of the RecQ helicase family, has recently been identified as a synthetic lethal target in microsatellite instability (MSI) tumors. The triazolo-pyrimidine compound HRO761 is the first WRN inhibitor to enter clinical trials, but research on this scaffold remains limited. Here, we designed a series of derivatives to systematically study the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of triazolo-pyrimidine scaffolds, leading to the discovery of compound S35. S35 exhibited excellent WRN helicase inhibitory activity (ADP-Glo kinase assay IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a016.1\u00a0nM, fluorometric helicase assay IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a023.5\u00a0nM). Additionally, S35 exhibited excellent cellular selectivity, with antiproliferative activity against multiple MSI cell lines (GI<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a036.4-306\u00a0nM), while the GI<sub>50</sub> values for multiple microsatellite stability (MSS) cell lines were greater than 20,000\u00a0nM. Furthermore, we observed that compound S35 induced DNA damage and caused G2/M cell cycle arrest in MSI cells, which did not occur in MSS cells. S35 demonstrated favorable oral pharmacokinetic properties, with oral administration resulting in dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in the SW48 xenograft model. These findings provide a promising outlook for the development of WRN inhibitors for the treatment of MSI tumors.",

        "abstract": "Werner syndrome of premature aging is caused by mutations in the WRN RECQ helicase/exonuclease, which functions in DNA replication, repair, transcription, and telomere maintenance. How the loss of WRN accelerates aging is not understood in full. Here we show that WRN is necessary for optimal constitutive heterochromatin levels in proliferating human fibroblasts. Locally, WRN deficiency derepresses SATII pericentromeric satellite repeats but does not reduce replication fork progression on SATII repeats. Globally, WRN loss reduces a subset of protein-protein interactions responsible for the organization of constitutive heterochromatin in the nucleus, namely, the interactions involving Lamin B1 and Lamin B receptor, LBR. Both the mRNA level and subcellular distribution of LBR are affected by WRN deficiency, and unlike the former, the latter phenotype does not require WRN catalytic activities. The phenotypes of heterochromatin disruption seen in WRN-deficient proliferating fibroblasts are also observed in WRN-proficient fibroblasts undergoing replicative or oncogene-induced senescence. WRN interacts with histone deacetylase 2, HDAC2; WRN/HDAC2 association is mediated by heterochromatin protein alpha, HP1\u03b1, and WRN complexes with HP1\u03b1 and HDAC2 are downregulated in senescing cells. The data suggest that the effect of WRN loss on heterochromatin is separable from senescence program, but mimics at least some of the heterochromatin changes associated with it.",

        "abstract": "The crosstalk and balance regulation of Wnt-Notch have been known to be essential for cell fate decision and tissue regeneration, however, how this balance is maintained and how the Wnt-Notch pathways are connected with cell cycle regulation is still not clear. By analyzing the molecular alterations in mouse model with accelerated aging phenotypes due to loss of p21 function in a Werner syndrome background, we observed that Wnt3 and \u03b2-Catenin were down-regulated, while Notch1 and Hes1 were up-regulated. This disruption in Wnt-Notch signaling was accompanied by the loss of intestinal stem cell compartment, increase in Bmi1 positive cells, loss of Olfm4/Lgr5 positive cells, and reduced secretory Paneth cells and goblet cells in the intestinal crypts of p21TKO mice. BrdU incorporation, cleaved caspase 3, and Tunel assay results revealed the fast turnover of intestinal epithelia, which may result in abnormal stem cell mobilization and exhaustion of the stem cell reservoir in the intestinal crypts. We further identified shift of DREAM complex towards MMB complex due to the loss of p21 as the cause for faster turnover of intestinal epithelia. Importantly, we identified the E2F1 as the transcriptional regulator for Notch1, which linked the p21-DREAM/MMB/Rb-E2F1 pathway with Wnt-Notch pathway. The overexpression of p21 rescued the DREAM pathway, as well as the imbalance of Wnt-Notch pathway. In summary, our data identify p21 as an important factor in maintaining sequential mobilization, proliferation, and homeostasis of intestinal stem cells.",

        "abstract": "This review starts off with the first germline homozygous variants of the Nucleoporin 98 gene (<i>NUP98</i>) in siblings whose clinical presentation recalls Rothmund-Thomson (RTS) and Werner (WS) syndromes. The progeroid phenotype caused by a gene associated with haematological malignancies and neurodegenerative disorders primed the search for interplay between caretakers involved in genome instability syndromes and Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) components. In the context of basic information on NPC architecture and functions, we discuss the studies on the interdependence of caretakers and gatekeepers in WS and Hereditary Fibrosing Poikiloderma (POIKTMP), both entering in differential diagnosis with RTS. In WS, the WRN/WRNIP complex interacts with nucleoporins of the Y-complex and NDC1 altering NPC architecture. In POIKTMP, the mutated FAM111B, recruited by the Y-complex's SEC13 and NUP96, interacts with several Nups safeguarding NPC structure. The linkage of both defective caretakers to the NPC highlights the attempt to activate a repair hub at the nuclear periphery to restore the DNA damage. The two separate WS and POIKTMP syndromes are drawn close by the interaction of their damage sensors with the NPC and by the shared hallmark of short fragile telomeres disclosing a major role of both caretakers in telomere maintenance.",

        "title": "PROTAC-mediated conditional degradation of the WRN helicase as a potential strategy for selective killing of cancer cells with microsatellite instability.",
        "abstract": "Multiple studies have demonstrated that cancer cells with microsatellite instability (MSI) are intolerant to loss of the Werner syndrome helicase (WRN), whereas microsatellite-stable (MSS) cancer cells are not. Therefore, WRN represents a promising new synthetic lethal target for developing drugs to treat cancers with MSI. Given the uncertainty of how effective inhibitors of WRN activity will prove in clinical trials, and the likelihood of tumours developing resistance to WRN inhibitors, alternative strategies for impeding WRN function are needed. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are heterobifunctional small molecules that target specific proteins for degradation. Here, we engineered the WRN locus so that the gene product is fused to a bromodomain (Bd)-tag, enabling conditional WRN degradation with the AGB-1 PROTAC specific for the Bd-tag. Our data revealed that WRN degradation is highly toxic in MSI but not MSS cell lines. In MSI cells, WRN degradation caused G<sub>2</sub>/M arrest, chromosome breakage and ATM kinase activation. We also describe a multi-colour cell-based platform for facile testing of selective toxicity in MSI versus MSS cell lines. Together, our data show that a degrader approach is a potentially powerful way of targeting WRN in MSI cancers and paves the way for the development of WRN-specific PROTAC compounds.",

WS is a segmental progeroid disease and shows early onset or increased frequency of many characteristics of normal aging. WRN possesses helicase, annealing, strand exchange, and exonuclease activities and acts on a variety of DNA substrates, even complex replication and recombination intermediates. Here, we review the genetics, biochemistry, and probably physiological functions of the WRN protein. Although its precise role is unclear, evidence suggests WRN plays a role in pathways that respond to replication stress and maintain genome stability particularly in telomeric regions.",

        "abstract": "Early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), defined as colorectal cancer in individuals under 50 years of age, has shown an alarming increase in incidence worldwide. We report a case of a twenty-four-year-old female with a strong family history of colorectal cancer (CRC) but without an identified underlying genetic predisposition syndrome. Two years after primary surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, the patient developed new liver lesions. Extensive diagnostic imaging was conducted to investigate suspected liver metastases, ultimately leading to a diagnosis of focal nodular hyperplasia. The young age of the patient has prompted comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic profiling in order to identify potential oncogenic drivers and inform further clinical management of the patient. Besides a number of oncogenic mutations identified in the patient's tumour sample, including KRAS G12D, TP53 R248W and TTN L28470V, we have also identified a homozygous deletion of 24.5 MB on chromosome 8. A multivariate Cox regression analysis of this patient's mutation profile conferred a favourable prognosis when compared with the TCGA COADREAD database. Notably, the identified deletion on chromosome 8 includes the WRN gene, which could contribute to the patient's overall positive response to chemotherapy. The complex clinical presentation, including the need for emergency surgery, early age at diagnosis, strong family history, and unexpected findings on surveillance imaging, necessitated a multidisciplinary approach involving medical, radiation, and surgical oncologists, along with psychological support and reproductive medicine specialists. Molecular profiling of the tumour strongly indicates that patients with complex mutational profile and rare genomic rearrangements require a prolonged surveillance and personalised informed interventions.",

        "abstract": "The underlying mechanisms of atherosclerosis, the second leading cause of death among Werner syndrome (WS) patients, are not fully understood. Here, we establish an in vitro co-culture system using macrophages (iM\u03c6s), vascular endothelial cells (iVECs), and vascular smooth muscle cells (iVSMCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. In co-culture, WS-iM\u03c6s induces endothelial dysfunction in WS-iVECs and characteristics of the synthetic phenotype in WS-iVSMCs. Transcriptomics and open chromatin analysis reveal accelerated activation of type I interferon signaling and reduced chromatin accessibility of several transcriptional binding sites required for cellular homeostasis in WS-iM\u03c6s. Furthermore, the H3K9me3 levels show an inverse correlation with retrotransposable elements, and retrotransposable element-derived double-stranded RNA activates the DExH-box helicase 58 (DHX58)-dependent cytoplasmic RNA sensing pathway in WS-iM\u03c6s. Conversely, silencing type I interferon signaling in WS-iM\u03c6s rescues cell proliferation and suppresses cellular senescence and inflammation. These findings suggest that M\u03c6-specific inhibition of type I interferon signaling could be targeted to treat atherosclerosis in WS patients.",

Previous studies indicated that males lacking the helicase domain of the Wrn protein orthologue exhibited hepatic transcriptomic and metabolic alterations. In this study, we used a label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approach to uncover proteins abundance associated with specific biological processes that differed depending on the age (four or ten months) and/or the genotype (wild type or Wrn mutant) in the serum and liver of mice. Principal component analysis of the proteomic data from both serum and hepatic tissue revealed a sexual dimorphism regardless of the age and the genotype of the mice. Moreover, although all Wrn mutant mice exhibited fatty liver by the age of ten months, a significant age and genotype dependent enrichment of proteins involved in lipid and fatty acid metabolic processes were uncovered only in males. Also, a genotype dependent increase in serum oxidant detoxification processes was observed in the serum of Wrn mutant males. Despite these sexual differences, several aspects of the immune system were affected in both females and males. Finally, an increase of specific immunoglobulin molecules was common in the liver and serum of both older Wrn mutant females and males. Such results suggest that specific immunoglobulin variants maybe associated with fatty liver progression in WS.",

        "abstract": "Ovarian Cancer (OC) is a heterogeneous malignancy with poor outcomes. Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in developing drug resistance. However, the relationships between Oxidative Stress-related Genes (OSRGs) and the prognosis of platinum-resistant OC remain unclear. This study aimed to develop an OSRGs-based prognostic risk model for platinum-resistant OC patients. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to determine the expression difference of OSRGs between platinum-resistant and -sensitive OC patients. Cox regression analyses were used to identify the prognostic OSRGs and establish a risk score model. The model was validated by using an external dataset. Machine learning was used to determine the prognostic OSRGs associated with platinum resistance. Finally, the biological functions of selected OSRG were determined via in vitro cellular experiments. Three gene sets associated with oxidative stress-related pathways were enriched (p < 0.05), and 105 OSRGs were found to be differentially expressed between platinum-resistant and - sensitive OC (p < 0.05). Twenty prognosis-associated OSRGs were identified (HR: 0:562-5.437; 95% CI: 0.319-20.148; p < 0.005), and seven independent OSRGs were used to construct a prognostic risk score model, which accurately predicted the survival of OC patients (1-, 3-, and 5-year AUC=0.69, 0.75, and 0.67, respectively). The prognostic potential of this model was confirmed in the validation cohort. Machine learning showed five prognostic OSRGs (SPHK1, PXDNL, C1QA, WRN, and SETX) to be strongly correlated with platinum resistance in OC patients. Cellular experiments showed that WRN significantly promoted the malignancy and platinum resistance of OC cells. The OSRGs-based risk score model can efficiently predict the prognosis and platinum resistance of OC patients. This model may improve the risk stratification of OC patients in the clinic.",

        "abstract": "The Werner syndrome RecQ helicase WRN was identified as a synthetic lethal target in cancer cells with microsatellite instability (MSI) by several genetic screens<sup>1-6</sup>. Despite advances in treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors<sup>7-10</sup>, there is an unmet need in the treatment of MSI cancers<sup>11-14</sup>. Here we report the structural, biochemical, cellular and pharmacological characterization of the clinical-stage WRN helicase inhibitor HRO761, which was identified through an innovative hit-finding and lead-optimization strategy. HRO761 is a potent, selective, allosteric WRN inhibitor that binds at the interface of the D1 and D2 helicase domains, locking WRN in an inactive conformation. Pharmacological inhibition by HRO761 recapitulated the phenotype observed by WRN genetic suppression, leading to DNA damage and inhibition of tumour cell growth selectively in MSI cells in a p53-independent manner. Moreover, HRO761 led to WRN degradation in MSI cells but not in microsatellite-stable cells. Oral treatment with HRO761 resulted in dose-dependent in vivo DNA damage induction and tumour growth inhibition in MSI cell- and patient-derived xenograft models. These findings represent preclinical pharmacological validation of WRN as a therapeutic target in MSI cancers. A clinical trial with HRO761 (NCT05838768) is ongoing to assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary anti-tumour activity in patients with MSI colorectal cancer and other MSI solid tumours.",

        "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are the second most prevalent cause of death in industrialized countries. Alzheimer's Disease is the most widespread and also most acknowledged form of dementia today. Together with Parkinson's Disease they account for over 90\u202f% cases of neurodegenerative disorders caused by proteopathies. Far less known are the neurodegenerative pathologies in DNA repair deficiency syndromes. Such diseases like Cockayne - or Werner Syndrome are described as progeroid syndromes - diseases that cause the premature ageing of the affected persons, and there are clear implications of such diseases in neurologic dysfunction and degeneration. In this review, we aim to draw the attention on commonalities between proteopathy-associated neurodegeneration and neurodegeneration caused by DNA repair defects and discuss how mitochondria are implicated in the development of both disorder classes. Furthermore, we highlight how nematodes are a valuable and indispensable model organism to study conserved neurodegenerative processes in a fast-forward manner.",

        "abstract": "WRN helicase is a critical protein involved in maintaining genomic stability, utilizing ATP hydrolysis to dissolve DNA secondary structures. It has been identified as a promising synthetic lethal target for microsatellite instable (MSI) cancers. However, few WRN helicase inhibitors have been discovered, and their potential binding sites remain unexplored. In this study, we analyzed potential binding sites for WRN inhibitors and focused on the ATP-binding site for screening new inhibitors. Through molecular dynamics-enhanced virtual screening, we identified two compounds, h6 and h15, which effectively inhibited WRN's helicase and ATPase activity in vitro. Importantly, these compounds selectively targeted WRN's ATPase activity, setting them apart from other non-homologous proteins with ATPase activity. In comparison to the homologous protein BLM, h6 exhibits some degree of selectivity towards WRN. We also investigated the binding mode of these compounds to WRN's ATP-binding sites. These findings offer a promising strategy for discovering new WRN inhibitors and present two novel scaffolds, which might be potential for the development of MSI cancer treatment.",

        "abstract": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a relatively common feature associated with multiple cancers, and Werner syndrome (WRN) ATP-dependent helicase has been recognized as a novel target for treating MSI cancers, such as colorectal cancer. A small-molecule inhibitor targeting WRN would be a promising strategy for treating colorectal cancer with high MSI expression. In this study, we employed a computer-assisted drug discovery strategy to screen over 30,000 natural product molecules. By using a combination of docking, ligand efficiency, Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA), and thermodynamic integration (TI) calculations, we identified MOL008980, MOL010740, MOL011832, T4743, TN1166, and TNP-002173 as potential WRN inhibitors. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulation revealed that these screened natural products possessed better binding dynamic characteristics than ATP substrate and were capable of inhibiting the dynamic process of WRN, making them potential strong ATP competitive inhibitors. In conclusion, our computational approach revealed potential WRN inhibitors from a natural product database, providing a theoretical basis for future research.",

        "abstract": "Purified translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases (Pols) replicate through DNA lesions with a low fidelity; however, TLS operates in a predominantly error-free manner in normal human cells. To explain this incongruity, here we determine whether Y family Pols, which play an eminent role in replication through a diversity of DNA lesions, are incorporated into a multiprotein ensemble and whether the intrinsically high error rate of the TLS Pol is ameliorated by the components in the ensemble. To this end, we provide evidence for an indispensable role of Werner syndrome protein (WRN) and WRN-interacting protein 1 (WRNIP1) in Rev1-dependent TLS by Y family Pol\u03b7, Pol\u03b9, or Pol\u03ba and show that WRN, WRNIP1, and Rev1 assemble together with Y family Pols in response to DNA damage. Importantly, we identify a crucial role of WRN's 3' \u2192 5' exonuclease activity in imparting high fidelity on TLS by Y family Pols in human cells, as the Y family Pols that accomplish TLS in an error-free manner manifest high mutagenicity in the absence of WRN's exonuclease function. Thus, by enforcing high fidelity on TLS Pols, TLS mechanisms have been adapted to safeguard against genome instability and tumorigenesis.",

        "abstract": "Werner syndrome (WS) is a rare genetic disease in humans, caused by mutations in the WRN gene that encodes a protein containing helicase and exonuclease domains. WS is characterized by symptoms of accelerated aging in multiple tissues and organs, involving increased risk of cancer, heart failure, and metabolic dysfunction. These conditions ultimately lead to the premature mortality of patients with WS. In this study, using the null mutant flies (WRNexo\u0394) for the gene WRNexo (CG7670), homologous to the exonuclease domain of WRN in humans, we examined how diets affect the lifespan, stress resistance, and sleep/wake patterns of a Drosophila model of WS. We observed that dietary restriction (DR), one of the most robust nongenetic interventions to extend lifespan in animal models, failed to extend the lifespan of WRNexo\u0394 mutant flies and even had a detrimental effect in females. Interestingly, the mean lifespan of WRNexo\u0394 mutant flies was not reduced on a protein-rich diet compared to that of wild-type (WT) flies. Compared to WT control flies, the mutant flies also exhibited altered responses to DR in their resistance to starvation and oxidative stress, as well as changes in sleep/wake patterns. These findings show that the WRN protein is necessary for mediating the effects of DR and suggest that the exonuclease domain of WRN plays an important role in metabolism in addition to its primary role in DNA-repair and genome stability.",

        "abstract": "According to current views the major hallmarks of physiological aging may be subdivided into three categories, primary causes of cellular damage (genomic instability, telomere attrition, loss of proteostasis, epigenetic alterations and compromised macroautophagy), antagonistic hallmarks that represent response to damage (deregulated nutrient sensing, cellular senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction) and integrative hallmarks that represent culprits of the phenotype (stem cell exhaustion, altered intercellular communication, chronic inflammation, dysbiosis). In contrast to physiological aging, premature aging diseases are driven by one or two distinct primary causes of aging, such as genomic instability in the case of Werner syndrome (WS), each displaying other hallmarks of aging to a variable extent. In this review we will focus on primary causes of well-investigated premature aging diseases Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), WS, and Cockayne syndrome (CS) and for each provide an overview of reported aging hallmarks to elucidate resemblance to physiological aging on the mechanistic level and in the context of characteristic age-related diseases. Ubiquitous and tissue specific animal models of premature aging diseases will be discussed as useful tools to decipher fundamental aging-related mechanisms and develop intervention strategies to combat premature aging and age-related diseases.",

His meticulous documentation of physical examination findings in his book Skin Signs of Systemic Disease became fundamental to the training of dermatologists worldwide for decades. In the context of autoimmune connective tissue diseases, Dr. Braverman's powerful observation skills proved pivotal in charting the clinical signs and symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus and dermatomyositis. His legacy as a trailblazer in clinicopathologic correlation continues to influence younger dermatologists, emphasizing the crucial role of connecting pathologic findings in the skin to systemic pathology in providing outstanding patient care.

        "abstract": "Dowling-Degos disease (DDD) is an extremely rare hereditary skin condition characterized by the development of painless, small-sized pigmented patches known as macules or keratotic papules. Typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, DDD primarily manifests in adulthood, with onset occurring between the ages of 30 and 40 years, and a higher prevalence among females. Although DDD shares clinical similarities with other reticulated pigmentary disorders such as dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria, dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria, and reticulate acropigmentation of Kitamura, its distinctive histopathological features set it apart. A 50-year-old female patient presented with hyperpigmented lesions since infancy, predominantly located in flexural areas, prompting consideration of endogenous eczema or DDD. Despite the absence of a family history and normal laboratory test results, a biopsy confirmed the diagnosis based on characteristic histological findings. The identification of DDD underscores the importance of considering rare dermatological entities in differential diagnosis, especially when clinical presentation aligns with established criteria. Further research and awareness are essential for enhancing our understanding and management of this intriguing skin condition.",

        "abstract": "Patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) have an increased risk of developing cancer. This includes not only hematologic malignancies and solid tumors but also cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) originating within the HS lesions. The development of SCC is most commonly associated with Caucasian men who smoke and have severe gluteal or perianal lesions of more than 25 years. Other factors that have occasionally been associated with HS-related SCC include treatment with a tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor (such as infliximab and adalimumab), genodermatoses (such as keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome and Dowling-Degos disease), and paraneoplastic syndromes (such as hypercalcemia, hypercalcemia-leukocytosis, and paraneoplastic neuropathy). The tumor may demonstrate the presence of human papillomavirus; even after treatment, patients have a poor prognosis because cancer metastasis, recurrence, or both commonly occur. The potential role of human papillomavirus vaccination for cancer prevention and early treatment of SCC with targeted therapy (with an epidermal growth factor inhibitor such as cetuximab) and/or checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy (such as cemiplimab and pembrolizumab) remains to be determined. Rarely, HS lesions have mimicked cutaneous metastases in patients with visceral malignancy by demonstrating an increased uptake of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose on positron emission tomography and/or computed tomography scans. Primary cancers (such as cutaneous SCC and mucinous adenocarcinoma) and breast cancer skin metastases can masquerade as HS lesions. When a lesion is located at a current or earlier site of HS that is new or rapidly growing and/or does not respond to HS-directed therapy, prompt evaluation to establish or exclude the diagnosis of cancer should be considered.",

        "abstract": "Malignant atrophic papulosis/K\u00f6hlmeier-Degos disease was first described in 1941 by K\u00f6hlmeier in an anecdotal case report that described a young man who presented with extensive multiple intestinal perforations and a papular skin rash. K\u00f6hlmeier-Degos disease represents a unique vasculopathy targeting both the microvasculature and the arterial system. One of its most characteristic features is reflected by the discrete multifocal depressed porcelain lesions involving the skin and gastrointestinal tract. The pathological findings are striking and can be broadly categorized into those that are vascular in nature versus extravascular matrix production in the context of extensive extravascular hyaluronic acid and collagen deposition. A dynamic evolutionary morphology is observed not only clinically but also histologically. The microvascular alterations are particularly evident in the skin and are characterized by endothelial cell necrosis with subsequent endothelial cell detachment accompanied by intraluminal fibrin deposition, defining a thrombogenic microangiopathy that in later stage lesions is typically pauci-inflammatory. The arterial lesions are very distinctive and include significant neointimal proliferation with vascular luminal occlusion by amorphous plugs of collagen intimately admixed with platelets. Pathogenetically enhanced type I interferon signaling and endothelial cell injury mediated by the membranolytic attack complex (ie, C5b-9) are key in the evolution of the thrombotic microvascular and obliterative fibrosing arteriopathic changes. We describe a case of K\u00f6hlmeier-Degos disease that developed in the setting of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitor therapy with the drug golimumab. The clinical features, light microscopic findings, and a pathophysiologic paradigm based on the critical role of TNF-alpha in controlling the type I interferon response are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Hereditary reticulate pigmentary disorders include a group of genetic disorders, with netlike pigmentation as their predominant presentation. Many of these hereditary reticulate pigmentary disorders have a wide array of cutaneous presentations with overlapping features. Furthermore, some of these disorders also have systemic manifestations. The overlapping features often add confusion and cause delay in diagnosis. Based on a literature search, we propose an easy-to-follow and concise diagnostic algorithm for diagnosis. This algorithm would aid in ordering a definitive genetic test. A thorough data search was done using the PubMed database with the following keywords: ('inherit*' OR 'genetic') AND ('reticulate AND pigment*'). Thereafter, a search for individual diseases was done using the keywords 'Dowling-Degos disease', 'dyschromatosis hereditaria symmetrica', 'acropigmentation of Kitamura', 'dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria', 'Naegeli-Franceschetti-Jadassohn syndrome', 'X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder' and 'dyskeratosis congenita'. The search included case reports, case series, observational studies, narrative and systematic reviews, and clinical trials. Acquired pigmentary disorders were excluded. In total, 1994 articles were retrieved. Finally, 625 articles were included for the review. The articles were narrative reviews (40), case series (23), observational studies (44) and case reports (518). An easy-to-follow clinical diagnostic algorithm was prepared based on age of onset, distribution and other parameters. This algorithm will aid in reaching a provisional diagnosis. Furthermore, this approach will help in the genetic investigations of a case of hereditary reticulate pigmentary disorder.",

        "abstract": "Galli-Galli disease (GGD) is a rare genodermatosis that exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance. GGD typically manifests with erythematous macules, papules, and reticulate hyperpigmentation in flexural areas. A distinct atypical variant exists, which features brown macules predominantly on the trunk, lower limbs, and extremities, with a notable absence of the hallmark reticulated hyperpigmentation in flexural areas. This review includes a detailed literature search and examines cases since GGD's first description in 1982. It aims to synthesize the current knowledge on GGD, covering its etiology, clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnosis, and treatment. A significant aspect of this review is the exploration of the genetic, histopathological, and clinical parallels between GGD and Dowling-Degos disease (DDD), which is another rare autosomal dominant genodermatosis, particularly focusing on their shared mutations in the <i>KRT5</i> and <i>POGLUT1</i> genes. This supports the hypothesis that GGD and DDD may be different phenotypic expressions of the same pathological condition, although they have traditionally been recognized as separate entities, with suprabasal acantholysis being a distinctive feature of GGD. Lastly, this review discusses the existing treatment approaches, underscoring the absence of established guidelines and the limited effectiveness of various treatments.",

        "abstract": "Dowling Degos disease (DDD) is a rare autosomal dominant genodermatosis characterized by acquired, slowly progressive reticulated pigmented lesions primarily involving flexural skin areas. Mutations in KRT5, POGLUT-1 and POFUT-1 genes have been associated with DDD, and loss-of-function mutations in PSENEN, a subunit of the gamma-secretase complex, were found in patients presenting with DDD or DDD comorbid with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). A nonsense mutation in NCSTN, another subunit of the gamma-secretase, was already described in a patient suffering from HS and DDD but whether NCSTN could be considered a novel gene for DDD is still debated. Here, we enrolled a four-generation family with HS and DDD. Through Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) we identified a novel nonsense mutation in the NCSTN gene in all the affected family members. To study the impact of this variant, we isolated outer root sheath cells from patients' hair follicles. We showed that this variant leads to a premature stop codon, activates a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, and causes NCSTN haploinsufficiency in affected individuals. In fact, cells treated with gentamicin, a readthrough agent, had the NCSTN levels corrected. Moreover, we observed that this haploinsufficiency also affects other subunits of the gamma-secretase complex, possibly causing DDD. Our findings clearly support NCSTN as a novel DDD gene and suggest carefully investigating this co-occurrence in HS patients carrying a mutation in the NCSTN gene.",

DDD is classically described in the flexural folds and, to our knowledge; less than a dozen cases of vulvar location are published in the literature. We postulate that DDD is responsible for the development of HS in susceptible patients. Indeed, this association seems to be explained by a common pathophysiological mechanism, targeting the Notch signalling pathway, involved in the proliferation and differentiation of epidermal cells that can induce the development of HS. DDD should be considered as a comorbid factor of HS.",

        "title": "Dowling-Degos Disease in the Anogenital Region.",
        "abstract": "Dowling-Degos disease (DDD) is a benign, rare genodermatosis (reticulate pigmented anomaly) of flexure sites with autosomal dominant inheritance (1,2).The disease is caused by a loss-of-function mutation of keratin 5 (KRT5) present on the chromosome 12q gene (3). It usually affects the younger population, most commonly 20-30 years of age, with some patients being older and with a predominance in the female population (4). The disease is characterized by formation of dark, hyperpigmented macules which are confined to the flexure sites, most commonly over the axillae, groin area, and neck, along with scattered, comedo-like lesions and pitted acneiform scars (3,5).The diagnosis is established based on clinical and histopathological correlation. We report the case of a 39-year-old patient who presented with a dark brown discoloration of the skin in the area of vulva, perineum, and perianal region (Figure 1) with occasional itching sensation that had suddenly appeared a year before presentation at our Department. Additionally, sparce brown macules were found in the left axillary region that had appeared a few months earlier. Histopathology of the skin showed fine and irregular elongation of the interpapillary cones with hyperpigmentation. Based on her clinical presentation and histopathology, the diagnosis of DDD was established. The patient was unsuccessfully treated with adapalene gel and refused the recommended oral retinoid therapy, as well as laser therapy. Dowling-Degos disease can present as an isolated disease or can be linked to other clinical entities. Usually, it presents with flat macules which are 3-5 mm in diameter and can vary in color from light brown to black (6). Furthermore, the disease is almost always asymptomatic, but pruritus has been reported in some cases (6), as observed in our patient. Even though DDD is primary a disease of the flexures, there have been reports of patients that have presented with hyperpigmented macules on the dorsum of the hands and feet (7). The affected areas in our patient were the anogenital region and left axillary region, and even though this combination of areas is rather uncommon, to our knowledge two similar cases have been reported in the literature (6,8). The most notable histopathological findings of DDD are elongation of rete ridges of the epidermis as well as hyperpigmentation, usually found in the lower third of the elongated rete ridges (6); both of those features were present in the skin biopsy specimen of our patient. Both the clinical picture and pathohistological findings are crucial for the diagnosis of DDD, and we can conclude that the findings of our patient were consistent with DDD. There are a number of closely related entities to Dowling-Degos disease: Galli-Galli disease (GGD), reticulate acropigmentation of Kitamura (RAPK), Haber disease, and symmetrical acropigmentation of Dohi. Galli-Galli disease has an almost identical clinical presentation, the only difference between those two entities being the presence of acantholysis on biopsy in GGD (9). RAPK presents with hyperpigmentation on the dorsum on the hands and feet, and that pattern has been observed in some patients with DDD as well as GGD (6,7,10-12). However, it differs from DDD in the presence of palmar and plantar pits and slight depression of pigmented lesions (6). Haber disease also has a very similar clinical presentation to DDD, with the presence of dark papules on flexure sites; however, central facial telangiectatic erythema was observed only in Haber disease (13). The clinical features of symmetrical acropigmentation of Dohi are the presence of hyperpigmented macules on the dorsum of the hands and feet, but intermingled areas of hypopigmented macules can also be observed, and the onset of the disease is earlier (infancy and early childhood) when compared with DDD (6,14). There are no successful treatments for DDD. Topical steroids may reduce the itching. Hydroxyquinone, a topical retinoid (adapalene gel), can be used for fading the pigmentation, but there rapid recurrence was reported when treatment was ceased (15). Systemic retinoids have also been unsuccessful. Er:YAG laser treatment has been reported to be effective, but only in a few cases (6,16,17). The goal of this paper was to present the case of a patient with DDD on the vulva, perineum, and perianal region as well as to describe the relationship of DDD with other members of the hyperpigmentative disease family.",

The present article gives the reader insight on the use of in silico modelling techniques to understand complex catalytic reaction mechanisms of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), along with the underlying theory and concepts that are important in this field. We start by introducing the significance of carbohydrates in nature and the enzymes that process them, CAZymes, highlighting the conformational flexibility of their carbohydrate substrates. Three commonly used in silico methods (classical molecular dynamics (MD), hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), and enhanced sampling techniques) are described for nonexpert readers. Finally, we provide three examples of the application of these methods to unravel the catalytic mechanisms of three disease-related CAZymes: \u03b2-galactocerebrosidase (GALC), responsible for Krabbe disease; \u03b1-mannoside \u03b2-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (MGAT5), involved in cancer; and O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1), involved in several human diseases such as leukemia and the Dowling-Degos disease.",

This case report involves a 55-year-old woman who was generally healthy but who had been experiencing asymptomatic, slowly progressive skin lesions for the previous four years.

        "abstract": "Dowling-Degos disease (DDD) is an autosomal dominant hereditary skin disease characterized by acquired reticular hyperpigmentation in flexural sites, and one of its causative genes is KRT5 gene. But the effect of KRT5, expressed only in keratinocytes, on melanocytes is unclear. Other pathogenic genes of DDD include POFUT1, POGLUT1 and PSENEN genes, which is involved in posttranslational modification of Notch receptor. In this study, we aim to determine the ablation of keratinocyte KRT5 affect melanogenesis in melanocyte through Notch signalling pathway. Here we found that KRT5 downregulation decreased the expression of the Notch ligand in keratinocytes and Notch1 intracellular domain in melanocytes, by establishing two cell models of ablation of KRT5 in keratinocytes based on CRISPR/Cas9 site-directed mutation and lentivirus-mediated shRNA. Treatment of melanocytes with Notch inhibitors had same effects with ablation of KRT5 on increase of TYR and decrease of Fascin1. Activation of Notch signalling reverses the effect of ablation of KRT5 on melanogenesis. Immunohistochemistry of DDD lesions with KRT5 gene mutation confirmed changes in the expression of relevant molecules in Notch signalling. Our research elucidates molecular mechanism of KRT5-Notch signalling pathway in the regulation of melanocytes by keratinocytes, and preliminary reveal the mechanism of DDD pigment abnormality caused by KRT5 mutation. These findings identify potential therapeutic targets of the Notch signalling pathway for the treatment of skin pigment disorders.",

        "title": "Lichen sclerosus: A C5B-9 mediated chronic microvascular injury syndrome potentially reflective of common adult comorbidities.",
        "abstract": "Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a cutaneous disease of unknown etiology that often involves the vulva or foreskin but also can affect extragenital sites. Regardless of the anatomic site, the histomorphology and presumably pathogenesis are similar. Perhaps a clue to the pathophysiology of LS lies in its frequent association with morphea, specifically, when occurring in an extragenital context. In our experience a striking feature evident in established lichen sclerosis (LS) is one of superficial vascular drop out whereby residual vessels exhibited endothelial cell necrosis and microvascular basement membrane zone thickening, the latter reflective of antecedent episodes of microvascular injury. We sought to understand the pathophysiology that underlies the distinct vascular changes and in doing so, shed light on the pathogenesis of LS. We examined 44 cases of LS over a period of 2019 to 2021. We were able to obtain past medical histories in 34 of the 44 cases. Regarding pathological assessment, the predominant focus was on microvascular changes. We assessed the role of C5b-9 mediated vascular injury in the pathogenesis of the vasculopathy and enhanced type I interferon signaling in vessels given the morphologic semblance to the select interferonopathy syndromes, namely fibrosing dermatomyositis and Kohlmeier Degos disease. We examined the expression of CMV DNA and protein based on prior observations in an earlier study that isolated early protein expression in the microvasculature in the setting of LS and scleroderma. From a clinical perspective, the most striking association was an older age at the time of diagnosis (mean age of 62 years and median age of 61.5 years) and the presence of vascular comorbidities of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia in almost 80% of cases. All cases showed significant microvascular changes in the superficial corium with the most frequent findings being those of significant basement membrane zone reduplication and vascular drop out. A number of cases showed prominent microvascular deposits of C5b-9 in the zone of hyalinizing fibrosis or subjacent to the discernible table of fibroplasia in the absence of enhanced type I interferon signaling. In no case were there viral cytopathic changes associated with CMV affecting the endothelium. The studies that encode CMV DNA or protein did not show a significant role for CMV reactivation in endothelium in the majority of the studied cases. It is concluded that the pathophysiology of LS includes a microvascular injury syndrome within the papillary dermis. The mechanism of endothelial cell injury is complement mediated at least in part and could reflect an adaptive immune response targeting endothelium indicative of classic complement pathway activation when coexisting with morphea or occurring in younger individuals. A non-immune based endothelial dysfunction and complement mediated injury unrelated to antibody driven classic complement pathway activation are more likely pathogenetically in the setting of certain diseases like diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Vascular drop out can be explained by the diminished endothelial progenitor pool needed to repopulate the damaged microvessels in certain settings like hypertension and diabetes.",

It usually affects people between the ages of 20 and 50. However, it can occur at any age. The condition is considered uncommon in children. Clinical characterization of paediatric patients with atrophic papulosis. Single-centre prospective cohort study with data derived from the international Degos Disease Registry collected between 2000 and 2021. Among 96 registered patients with atrophic papulosis fulfilling the criteria, 19 were aged 0 to completed 17\u2009years at the time of onset. The median age at the time of onset was 5\u2009years, ranging from 0 to 1\u2009years for girls to 8\u2009years for boys. In contrast to adult patients (male-to-female ratio 1:2.2), there was a male predominance in paediatric patients with a male-to-female ratio of 1.7:1. Systemic involvement, in particular gastrointestinal, central nervous system and cardiac, was more frequent in children than in adult patients. There were no statistically significant differences between family history, multisystem involvement, mortality and median survival time in the two groups. Atrophic papulosis has some distinct features in the paediatric population. It presents an important and still under-recognized problem. Therefore, it is mandatory to pay attention to the typical skin lesions in combination with neurological or gastrointestinal symptoms in order to make a prompt and accurate diagnosis.",
